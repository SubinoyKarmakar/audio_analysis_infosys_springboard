a space that Hollywood studios have abandoned, which is the bigger budget, $80 million films that can have big stars, maybe be in English, maybe be in French, and could travel around the world, but not compete with like a Marvel or a Star Wars movie. Scott Roxra, European bureau chief of the Hollywood Reporter, talking to me about the recent boom in screen production in France. You've been listening to the Final Cut. I'm Jason DeRosso, hope you enjoyed the show. See you next week.
