It's still making all these all these motions and act of doing all that it can't stay alive But the flesh has been has been dealt the death below and the flesh is dying out I don't mean to say it's losing its influence. It's still there be with us to the day that we die but the flesh is lost Know that your sinful flesh has been defeated by Christ Jesus And that's why Paul would say in Romans 6 Reckon or consider yourself dead to sin but alive into God Tell yourself the truth about who you are in Christ over and over again Tell yourself the truth I have to do it preach yourself sermons tell yourself I Am no longer a slave to sin I am not a child of the devil. I don't belong to the world. I don't even belong to myself. I belong to Christ Christ has redeemed me. He has cleansed me. I still mess up. I still struggle and I war but I am victorious in Christ And I do not have to yield my flesh That kind of thinking is walking in the Holy Spirit That kind of thinking is living under the influence of the Spirit of God Because the gospel tells us this The gospel tells us that not only did Jesus die to save us from the penalty of sin Or in other words to make us justified not only did Christ die to one day glorify us the Christ died for us Also that we might have victory in this life even now Even now that we no longer are slaves to sin because Christ has broken those Chains so may we walk in the Spirit May we enjoy more of the communion of the Holy Spirit As he takes the good things of God in the word of God and shares them with us But we remember the Spirit leads us to liberty And often to the right use of liberty to walk with him as the center and Loving one another and yielding to him and not to our flesh In closing, let me read you one of our favorites or one of my favorites from our study in Philippians this beautiful prayer Philippians 11 For Paul praises them and the prayer includes this in verse 11 being filled with the fruits of Righteousness which are by who which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God. Let's bow Father, we thank you for the glorious gift of the Holy Spirit We do not understand you of God you are one and yet there is three in one And we could not make it without the love of the Father without the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord nor without the work and the Ministry and the communion of the Holy Spirit So Father, we give praise to the Holy Spirit this morning. We thank you O Holy Spirit for all of your work in our lives and Father, we pray that we would walk in the Spirit more and more that we would say no and resist our flesh But we would not resist the Spirit that we would yield to him And that we would be influenced in our words in our actions and our thoughts and all that we do by his blessed ministry where we pray it in Jesus name and for his sake amen
