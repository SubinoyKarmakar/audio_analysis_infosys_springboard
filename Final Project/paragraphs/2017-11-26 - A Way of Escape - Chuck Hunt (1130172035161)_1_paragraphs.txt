realize that had you left that go it would have been very serious and could have even caused you to or card to malfunction and something happened and so Understand that we are going to have problems and That a problem-free life is not the goal of a Christian The goal of the Christian is to grow Through these times of trouble these times of trial and is to learn Wisdom in these times and let these things temper us let these things train us let these things turn us into the image of Jesus Christ That's the Christian life and he even in the mist Miss miss are even in the actual Problem he or she can find the grace of God To live now look with me will come right back so please mark your place But go to 1 Corinthians 10 and verse 13 This is a very classic passage in Dealing with troubles and dealing with trials We all need to know this you need to know it by heart or at least where to find it and you need to understand it In 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 13 There is no temptation taking you But such as this common to man But God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able But we'll with the temptation also make a way to escape The you may be able to bear it There are two lies that the devil wants to sell you There are two lies that he wants to deceive you with One is that no one has ever gone through your problem No one has ever dealt with what you're dealing with It is totally unique in other words the Bible would work You say but my problem is unique no one else has ever had this problem. That's a lie There's no temptation taking you but such as this common to man that's God's word If you are experiencing something other people have experienced it and here the context is people in the Lord And so don't have the lie well, you know if everybody knew what I was going through I mean nobody nobody at church has ever gone through what I've gone through nobody has ever gone through this You see but you realize that trials and temptations are common to man Common to the children of God So do not claim that yours is so unique That no one understands and that no one has ever gone through this and the idea is you're setting yourself up for a pessimism and And the justification of why your problem is You know you can't there's no solution. That's the second lie. There's no way to escape There's no way to get out of this problem. There's no way to overcome this problem Look at here if there had no temptation taking you Note that taking you I mean problems you don't necessarily wake up say I want to go out and find three problems today Problem sees you and they take you There are no temptation taking you but such as this common demand, but God is faithful God is faithful Who will not let suffer you to be tempted above that you're able And actually will turn this into three lies that the world then Satan tried to bring upon you The second one here and I'll just go ahead and interrupt my thought and do this one and deal deal with them in the order of the text the second lie Is as it says here God will not Permit you to be tempted above that which you're able In other words other people have had temptations, but this one is too strong I mean in my temptation in my trial, you know, I have to succumb I have to fall I have to I just can't get out of it because it You kind of tie the two together. It's so unique and it's so powerful But God said that that you will not be tempted you will not have a trial That is greater than what through his help you can overcome And the third thing He said but with the temptation who also make a way to escape that you may be able to bear it And so what we find here is that this is our wrong thinking First of all my problems unique no one has ever had my problem certainly no one at church understands my problem I mean my problem there probably be a solution, but my problem is unique Secondly my problem is so great. I mean it's greater than what I can do It's greater than what I can overcome. There's just no way even with the Lord's help Someone told me that someone was quoted as saying My not even God can help me. I'm not a member here, but
