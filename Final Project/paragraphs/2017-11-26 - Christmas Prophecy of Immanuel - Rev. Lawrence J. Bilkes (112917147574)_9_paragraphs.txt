Maybe, for a time, but which friend or companion in hell will be able to comfort you by saying, I'm here, I'm with you. What comfort would that give to be in hell with a friend who you let astray and he led you astray? There is no friendship in hell. But why would you perish? When today he comes with his gospel and he says, but I can be the scourge and savior to you, I am Emmanuel in the blood and righteousness of Jesus. Take refuge to me, lay hold of me, plead for the fulfillment of this promise also in your life. I know God's children can at times be afraid. They have to go for surgery sometimes, or they have to go another difficult way. That's how it can be too for you children. Sometimes you're afraid of the dark maybe, or afraid of having to sleep alone. Maybe you go and visit Graham and Grandpa and then it's bedtime and then you miss your mummy so much and you're in a strange bed. You're in a strange house, a grandma or grandpa prays with you. Maybe then you still can't fall asleep and you're ready to cry but then Graham says, do you want me to lay by you? And then yes, that would be nice. Your tears can be wiped away and you become restful. And before long you go to sleep. That's what the Lord wants to give you, in Emmanuel. God with us in life and in death, in prosperity and adversity. Comfort, ever O Lord with thee, all shall be well with me, held by thy hand.
