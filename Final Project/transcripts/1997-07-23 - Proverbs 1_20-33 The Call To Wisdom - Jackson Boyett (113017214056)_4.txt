 doctrine. All I want to know is Jesus. The problem is brothers and sisters, nine times out of ten, they're lying when they say that because it was Jesus who taught about the things they usually don't want to know about, like predestination and hell and divorce and all of the difficult subjects that come up. It's Jesus who taught about those things, but they have the idea that if they can just stay somewhere safely within Matthew, Mark, Luke and John and never get into Romans and never get into Hebrews and never get into anything in the Old Testament that that's just fine. And they willfully put blinders on themselves and they say, I just want to know about Jesus. What they don't realize is that there's enough in Matthew, Mark, Luke and John to condemn you and me without any problem whatsoever. And it's all from the words of Jesus whom they claim they want to know about. So the point is this is a group of people that say, you know, don't confuse me with a lot of scripture. Don't confuse me with doctrine. Don't ask me to think about anything. I don't want to know about it. I want to lead a very, very simple existence with my simple little view of God that I have thought up out of my own simple heart. That's what they want. And this is what wisdom is condemning. Wisdom is saying, wake up. Wisdom is saying, you cannot lead a blissfully ignorant life. You've got to know things and understand things. And I'm here for you. Receive me. It's an invitation. And it's an invitation with some exasperation. How long are you going to continue on like this? How long are you going to not consider the things of God? How long will you love just a very simple, narrow view? And it's quite clear that at underneath all the affected naivete and simplicity is a scorner. For scorners delight in their scorning and underneath that scorner is a fool. For fools hate knowledge. I've got some relatives and they are very, very simple people. They don't have college education or anything like that. They're very hardworking people. They are in many ways very, very good people. They never have had much money and they never have had any aspirations to anything above just kind of manual labor jobs. And they're good folks. I enjoy visiting with them. But one thing I'd better do is keep my mouth shut about the gospel if I want to stay in their house. It's just that simple. Because they've served notice many, many times that they don't want nobody talking to them about God. Now these are a willfully simple people, brothers and sisters, just the kind of people that wisdom is calling out to. People who, now see, I've got some other relatives that are very well educated and very well to do and capable of very deep philosophical thought. And they have very carefully excluded God from their lives. But the point is that the common salt of the earth types have to. So this is the point. Wisdom calls out with a confrontation and says, how long are you going to be like this? How long are you going to be like this? Maybe I ought to read verse 22 to my relatives and run. How long you simple ones will you love simplicity? You see, this is what's being talked about. This simplicity is not just a lack of knowledge. It's a lack of knowledge with a moral problem. So here is the invitation, verse 23. Goes from confrontation to invitation. Turn at my rebuke. Turn at my rebuke. All of you know the ten dollar theological word that is a sin and M for turn, don't you? Repent. Repent means deterrent.
