 first us on the Indians chapter 5, verse 11. Verse 11, you with me? Therefore, what does it say? Encourage. Some translations say comfort. One another and build one another up just as you are doing. Guess what this word encourage is. It's the word paraclete but in the verb form. The word paraclete appears the five times that I've just shared with you. But here's something very, very interesting, something very important. God has given us the ministry of paracleting. In 2 Corinthians 5, we've been given the ministry of reconciliation. We participate with God in the ministry of reconciliation. It's seen people come to truss crisis or savior and have an intimate saving relationship with him. And we have a part in that. It's called the ministry of reconciliation. Here we are given the ministry of paracleting. It's the verb paraclete and it's in parative form and it's purl. It's you. If we were down south, we would say, y'all. He's saying paraclete one with another. That's the command. It's the verb for paraclete. Paracleto. And it's to the church. It's to us. This is really neat. We are many agents of the Holy Spirit. We are many agents of Jesus Christ. We are many paracletes. We are given the ministry of paracleting. It's in the imperative form. Paracleto one with another. Paraclete one with another. And edify one with another just as you are doing. But do it more. And expand our paraclete ministry. We are called to come alongside. So I need your help again. Thank you. I don't have any chocolates here or anything to give you. But you're probably still full from Thanksgiving, right? Sure. Okay. So we have Jesus here. Have the Holy Spirit here. Hold your hands out, please. We're in the hands of the Father. And on top of that, God has given us the ministry of paracleting. We are called by God to come alongside of others. And sometimes it's to comfort them, right? Sometimes it's to absorb and correct. And sometimes it's to pray. And you've been without work for three months. And so I can give you a gift to help you. I can do that. And I should do that. So I can help you financially. And I can accompany you. And I can encourage you. And I can correct you. And I can help you. And I can disciple you. I can come alongside of you. And forgive the example. So if your wife has cancer, my wife can go with her for the treatments. And we can bring some meals over. And we can watch the kids for you. And we can shovel your walk with that ugly white stuff that's coming soon. We can take care of that. And I can walk with you. And I can accompany you. And I can cry with you. And I can pray with you. And I can help you. And we've been called to come alongside as many paracletes to aid one another according to their need in my abilities. And tell me, when my abilities are limited, and I can't help him in the way that he needs, apart from God, listen to me, apart from God, who ounces there to help him when I can't do it, because I have human limitations. Right. And apart from the Holy Spirit and God, who ounces here to help him when I have my physical limitations? And I can't help him. The church. We. The body. We are the body of Christ, we're the family of God, we're the bride of Christ. All of us, every last one of us, has been given a spiritual gift, and every last one of us has been given the ministry of paracleting. This is written to the church. It's a command. All of us are to come alongside. And what I can't do, another brother can do. And what that brother can't do, a sister can do. And what you can't do, she can do. And what she can't do, he can do. And we come alongside. And finally, when no one can do it, yes, we have a perfect almighty paraclete that can do it. But otherwise, we have our paracleting ministry. Thank you. How do we fulfill this paraclete?
