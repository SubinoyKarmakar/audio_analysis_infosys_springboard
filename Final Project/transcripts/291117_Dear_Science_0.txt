 Science is interesting and if you don't agree you can f*** off. It is time for dear science. How are we on? Oh we're busy, Lily and we're busy. We're busy. It's summer school time so I've got to rush off and give two lectures after this. And you've just had two lectures? I just had two lectures, yes, yes no rest and all that. Is that, I mean there's a lot of work. It's a lot of work for the kids, the poor things. So you think any of them listen to BFM or listen to your show? Foo, I don't know, I'll find out after this. Would they get extra marks if they did? Doubtless, doubtless. There you go guys. Listen to me. Hey actually we should tell you this segment is the second highest rated or followed podcast on BFM. So congratulations. That's all you. I doubt that. But it's all good. Yeah. Oh that's fantastic news. Cool. We aren't joined by Rumeich, I should let you know because he's been covering another show. So he's taking a break from Wednesdays. Fair enough. Anyway, lightning. Okay. Creating lightning, creating anti-matter in that atmosphere. What does that mean? Okay, well it's, everybody knows that lightning's pretty powerful stuff. And somebody's just, you know, sort of described it as being pure electricity, which it basically is. And you can get sort of temperatures up to 50,000 degrees Celsius and stuff in a lightning strike and, you know, very, very, very highly energetic. And so it's been thought for a while that perhaps it's energetic enough to be able to carry out sort of nuclear reactions, so reactions on the chemical nucleus. And so some Japanese scientists decided to test this. And they did this on the basis that they've known for quite some time that lightning bursts emit these things called gamma rays. And gamma rays are really, really, really, really energetic particles essentially. And when you've got really, really energetic particles, it's possible that they can interact with the chemical nucleus and get it to do weird things. Okay. And some of those, well, one of those weird things is create anti-matter, which we'll talk about in a minute. And so what they did was to set up essentially a radiation detector on top of a nuclear power station of all places in Japan. And they were monitoring a thunderstorm that was very, very close. And it's kind of difficult to set all this sort of stuff up. So you've got to have, you know, a thunderstorm within Kui. Otherwise, this isn't going to work. So they got lucky. And what they found with the radiation detector was that they were seeing a very short burst of gamma rays, so about 200 milliseconds of gamma rays. And then after that, what they were seeing were some positrons and neutrinos and neutrons. So they were detecting these now. Okay. What are these things? What are positrons? What are positrons are antimatter? Okay. So quick chemical chemistry lesson. Okay. Nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Okay. New that one. Didn't you get one? And then surrounding those are electrons. So those are your three basics of matter. Okay. Now antimatter are the anti-conversions of matter. Okay. So instead of protons, we've got anti-protons. Instead of neutrons, we've got anti-neutrons. And instead of electrons, we've got positrons. So they all charged to, absolutely to, well, the anti-neutrons aren't. Okay. But the anti-protons and the anti-electrons or the positrons are. So the positrons are positively charged electrons. And when a positively charged electron meets a negatively charged electron, then we get annihilation. Okay. So that's antimatter meeting matter. And you get annihilation and you get emission of gamma radiation and lots of energy. So when you say annihilation, it's not like a nuclear explosion that just can't cling to the rail. What kind of scale? Yeah, no. You do get a decent amount of energy out of all of this. But you need a decent amount of energy to create this sort of situation. It's always like, for the, in terms of lightning. Yes, you do. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And so like, if you've ever had a PET scan, positron emission, tomography scan, so that is, that uses antimatter. That uses positrons and the interactions of these with actual matter. And then you get the radiation that emits from that and that gives you pictures sort of the inside of your body. So that's... I did not know that. Ah, okay. It's always good when I tell Will something to be not unhappy about that. Because Will knows a bit, you know. I know some things. That's how you do it. You do. I know at least three things. Because I always, I always thought, you know, when I think about the antimatter of center on TV and things like that, it's always talked about as this mysterious thing that's in space and it doesn't have this crazy stuff. But we're utilizing it for medicine. Yes, absolutely. I do not know that. Yeah. It's almost gonna laugh at me, but I don't care. Well, I didn't know what PET scan stood for. So there we go. Okay, so that's... Okay, so we're all... Someone can laugh at me as well. We've all learned something, okay?
