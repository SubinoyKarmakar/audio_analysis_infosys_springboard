 If somebody dies and goes to hell, it is not because he sent them there. It's because you rejected his son. You rejected his son. He said, percharm a good person. I've done some bad things. There's been sometimes my life's been out of sorts, but I'm a pretty good person. Can I say something tonight if you don't know Christ, you're lost. And you're going to hell. Can I say something I'm thankful that God put people in my life that we're not afraid to stand in front of me and say, son, you're going to hell. Amen. You don't know Jesus, you're going to hell. Now I appreciate you breaking the grass. Now I appreciate you mowing the yard. I appreciate you opening the door for that elderly lady coming out of the grocery store. And I appreciate you going and helping her put her groceries in her vehicle. Can I tell you something? If you would have asked anybody about me, can I tell you something? Even though we were not in church, my mama, we didn't go to church, but I'm telling you what, my mama. She whooped my hind end. She taught me and she made me act right. She taught me and she made me be respectful. She taught me what it was to say, yes, ma'am, and no ma'am, and yes, sir, and no, sir. If you'd ask anybody, they'd say, boy, it's a good kid right there. He's a respectful young man. He's an obedient young man. But can I tell you something on February 24th? Can I tell you all of my goodness and all of my righteousness was nothing more than filthy rage in the sight of God. In the sight of God. I was my grandma's boy. I was my grandpa's boy. I could do no wrong in their eyes, but I was lost. I was lost. And to this day, when we go to bed, some of you have been up probably early this morning. I don't remember exactly what time I rolled out of the bed. I think it was actually this morning, a little before seven, maybe six, thirty or so. I rolled out of the bed. I don't know after church. Sometimes it takes me a while to come down off my high. But when my pillow my head tonight in the 24-hour period of this day, what is, I don't even know what the date is. What is the date? November 30th. When the 24-hour period that is allotted in November 30th is said nine. There will be in all sense reality. And I understand I, no man knows, nobody knows, but I'm talking about through guestimation, 151,600 people. Can I make a statement right here? If you took most churches, it would take years of services for them to ever have 151,000 people. I don't know what you run here, but let's just shoot in the darkness, say 70 people. Say, home Sunday morning, you have 70 people. Well, the next Sunday, on Sunday morning, you had 70 people. That's 140. We got a long way to go. But yet, according to statistics, that many people today will die. They took their last breath. Can I tell you something? I'm 47 years old. I'll be 48 next year. I still, from time to time, I still look at my children, even the oldest one, and the 16 year old too. I still look at him, I say, hey, you know you say it. I still question him. You say, why? Because that's a serious thing. I never will forget when my kids got under conviction. And God began to work in their lives, and I, as a parent me and my mom, and me, and their mother knew that God was working on them. We knew they were under conviction, and they'd go to the altar. And man, I'd just make a baseline right behind them. Sometimes they'd come get me, and they would go to the altar. And when I'd get down, when I'd see the little trembling lips, and I'd see the look on their face, and I'd say, what are we praying about? And they'd stutter and stammer around. I want to pray for Poppaal, he said, or I want to pray for Nanny, she said, okay. You know what I'd do? I'd pray, whatever they'd ask me to pray, that's what I pray. And then right before I got done, and I said Lord, what?
