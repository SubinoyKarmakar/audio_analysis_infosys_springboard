 You can just take half a joke and they're already laughing. You say, hey, remember when? Oh, yeah, and they can talk about what happened 10 years ago. Oh, yeah, and these things you bring up and they they bond you together That's that's the idea of relationship shared experiences over period of time the Lord wants the same with us Now watch this the more time We spend with God the more boldness We'll have in prayer The better I know the more bold I can be when I speak to him. I don't mean in a in a Disrespectful way. I don't mean a big guy in the sky But I'm talking about I go to him because I can say Lord I remember when you did this When you answered this prayer I can go back and say Lord I believe you know, I mean I'm sure you've had the same experience I get done praying and Before I'm before I maybe four ten minutes are out God has answered that prayer You know to me that's an amazing thing I just prayed about this and then something out of the blue happens, which is an answer to the prayer I just ask about now when that happens I say hey Lord Remember remember when I prayed and I asked you to do this and you did it boom right away Poor what a wonderful God and it gets me more boldness to ask for more things That's what a relationship does the more time we spend with the Lord than the more boldness than we have in prayer because we have these shared Experiences over a period of time One of the great hindrances to a productive prayer life, you know when we pray Okay, we're I'm assuming this that we're not Catholic here, right? We're not we're supposed to be born again believers We're in a Baptist church. We believe in the in the The priesthood of the believer that I go straight to the holy of Holies and speak to God himself in a very personal way And so I don't go in there like like a And again not in disrespectful way not like hey Lord I got some things I know I go in there and I and I praise him Yes, and I confess my sins, but I also go bowling and say now Lord You've told me some things and you made some promises to me and Lord I expect some things based on what you said And I want you to do these things in my life and all I'm asking is for you to keep your word that you promised me now Lord, I know there's some things I got to do and I'm going to try to do those but Lord I'm counting on you to do what you promise to do now Lord Here's what you've done in the past you met this needing you've done this and Lord I'm counting on you do there's a boldness in prayer that the Lord wants from Now the great hindrance to that the great hindrance to a productive prayer life to a boldness in our prayer life is this we ignore God except in emergencies and we don't know them we have no shared experience we have no answer to prayer to go back on you know it's hard to call someone friend if you never ever talked to them you know the the illustration of Lord give gave was this you go to a friend at midnight not to a stranger now the what Jesus said is okay he's not gonna give to you just cuz he's a friend he's gonna give to you because the opportunity and that and it's teaching this idea of begging begging asking but what's inferred in this is he went to a friend not even a stranger I guess would be bothered by the opportunity so there should be this personal relationship we have the Lord but we ought to be able to say Lord I know you I know what you've done I've seen what you've done in my life and Lord I'm coming again believing and trusting that's what it's talking about this idea of relationship this is what the Lord wants not just like he's up in sky and looking down like we're a bunch of like it's like an pharma he's like well look at what are they doing now huh oh I never thought that okay we're not an ant farm we're not a bunch of hamsters running on wheels God wants a personal relationship he wants to talk and walk with us we give you a couple interesting verses go with me to James chapter two James chapter two now we're gonna look at a verse in James and go back to Genesis to look at the the basis of this James chapter two we're talking about Abraham here to look at verse 23 and the scriptures fulfilled what Seth Abraham believed God and it was imputed into him for righteousness and he was called the what friend of God there's a personal relationship now there's several things that's being talked about here but we're gonna go to one of them look with me in Genesis 18 we're good
