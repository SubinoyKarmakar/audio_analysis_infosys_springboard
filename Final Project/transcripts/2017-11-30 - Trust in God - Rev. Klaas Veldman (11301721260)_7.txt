 You don't take care of your mother anymore. We need houses for it and installations and services paid. Yeah, but I don't want to rely on my children. Say that's not a problem. But you should first buy a theater. They don't like me. First buy a theater. Love again. To equit their parents. And listen again. For that is good and acceptable for God. It's a command of our God's father and mother. But Paul doesn't say it's a command. He says it's acceptable to God. It's pleasing to God. We understand him. I don't know if he don't. We'll not under the law. If you're a Christian, he speaks to Christians here. And they're not under the law. Paul says, I'd like to go. Love, I don't want that I might live and to God. That I might have a desire to seek the favor of God. And you can do it by the law. You can only do it by raising Christ Jesus. We've seen in days, these days, that people bring the law back behind the gospel, spoiling the gospel. That's anti-Numian. The law has only one purpose to convict. And Rathis, coming to my head. But I'm not under the law, but under grace, that's the fulfilled law. It says James. That's love. We should need every need in the reformation, in this point. Do you know how it comes? Conviction is not done proper, in preaching. And therefor, grace is no grace. And love is no love. That's always mixed. I have to, and I must. You're going to lust. You're not under the law. But under grace, that's too easy for the pastor. You know, grace is very difficult. You always want to pay. The Lord Jesus had an impeller. He says, if you have a feast, a dinner, ask those people who can't pay you back. Because you normally, he says, make a dinner for your friends who can have and give you a dinner. But God makes a dinner for those who can't pay them back. That's me. You're not able to do it. Broken ends, broken hearts, and a blind eye. That's the nature of a man. Grace is outside of me, Christ. But it seems to be that the gospel has no power. But do you know what Paul says? The promise of the Phil's the law. Glory to the eternal, good pleasure of God. It's grace. The city of Jerusalem is free. And then I come and it's a pastor. I must. You're still a poor guy. You're still a must. You're still a poor guy. You're a must. You're a must. You never died to a must. Did you die to a must, dear friend? Or a poor guy? Christ, there is no power. You're on your own. The God is still. You see it in the fruit. Pastor, I must pray. God's people can't pray. You know what the Lord Jesus says? I'll teach you to pray. But I say what you should pray. I make you a child not ready to pray. And I say, play after me. Or pray with me. Our Father, my Father, and you, Father. Which are.
