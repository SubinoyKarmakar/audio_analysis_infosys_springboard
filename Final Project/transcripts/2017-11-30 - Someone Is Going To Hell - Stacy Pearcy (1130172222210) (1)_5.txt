 sets around quiet and we set around silent and we set around without a burden and without a brokenness and ain't being ugly but listen to what I'm saying is this is we come in contact with people every day of our lives. We'll never handle the gospel track too. That we won't have enough God in our lives but even in our silence they know there's something different about us. Look like the world, act like the world, walk like the world, treat people like the world, treat people instead of like the life of Christ inside of us and we wonder why though the songwriter penned it years ago, can the world see Jesus in you? Can they see his love and the things that you do? Are you living the life? Are you faithful? Are you true? Can the world see Jesus? See Jesus in you? I look at the clock on the back wall, one or two things either I'm blind and can't see it or the second hand is so small that I can't see it but I can see that the meaning of hand is progressing quite quickly. We know what Brother Joe's today and Brother Joe's dear wife took me around, showed me clocks, clocks ever were and some of them clocks but John's still here, he's still here, take, take, take, take, take, somebody went to hell, take, take, take, take, take, oh somebody went to have a take, take, take, take, that's a whole family went out to a car wreck when to have a take, he'll every take, every take, every take, every take, every take before we get done tonight, there are people all draw their last breath. Before we get done tonight there'll be people that are draw their, they'll prepare, they'll never let's get the pillow their head. They'll never get to lay their head on their pillow and pillow their head tonight because of the fact is they'll draw their last breath before it ever gets time to the end of the day. Tonight it ought to scare us, it ought to put a fear inside of us, it ought to put something inside of us, and it ought to stir something inside of us that the fact of the matter is is somebody's going to hail. Take you Bible if you would be able to book a revelation. The book of revelation. And I want to be honest with you, can I just go ahead and say something right here and now it's to the point in the independent fundamental Bible believing churches if you preach on hell you're trying to scare people into a decision. I'm not being ugly, I'm about tired of these wimpy babbush churches that they want to come in and it just wants to be sweetness and kindness and all that kind of stuff and and you know let's just worship Jesus let's not think about the negative let's not think about the negative can I say something? I don't see how you can look at hell and think about anything but negative. The only positive thing about hell's I'm not going. Hellelujah. Bible said this the book of revelation now you know this to be the great white throne judgment Bible said nice all great white throne him that set on it from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away and there was found no place for them revelation chapter number 20 verse number 11 verse 12 and look at this next statement and I saw the say it next word say it again I saw the what? Dead say these next three words small and great can I tell you something there's going to come a day when every person that is not accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior no matter how small no matter how great they were no matter how wealthy they more were no matter how poor they was no matter what they had in their in their hip pocket no matter what they did not have in their hip pocket no matter what they had in their bank account no matter what they didn't have in their bank account he said I the small and the great are going to stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged are those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire you say preacher of this God you preach about it's such a loving God he wouldn't see him people of hell can I say something to now
