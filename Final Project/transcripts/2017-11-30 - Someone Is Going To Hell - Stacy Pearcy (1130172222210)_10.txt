 God said, well I didn't know, oh yes you didn't know too. And see what he'll do is he'll take you back to a service on November the 30th, 2017. A little church by the name of Pleasant Valley Baptist Church, went a loud mouth of nopsious Baptist evangelists from Tennessee. He said, he said, yes you need him. And what he's going to do at that day, he's going to go to that book and every person, every person, he's going to take the time. You say how you know that, because that's what he said. He said, whoever's name was not found written, so he's going to look safe and threatened. He's going to come to you and he's going to say, all right. Oh. The next person. See if you go back to the book of Matthew, the book of Matthew paints a picture of those that are going to say, Lord did we not prophesy on the name? And I'm not name cast out many devils and I'm not name doing many wonderful works. And he's going to say, department, I never knew you. You know how he's going to be able to say that, I never knew you, because they're names from out in this book. I preach a Christian school service one morning. I ain't been able to talk about a challenge, some of the most challenging services of Christian schools, because most of them are a bunch of self-righteous blowhards. Amen. They got their tags, their identities, they got their hair right and their clothes are right and they've got everything right and it's a bunch of self-righteousness but anyhow, that's another story for another time. And I'm telling you what I preach that I don't even really remember what I preached on, but somehow in the end of it, I ended up not coming out of the pulpit just like a amen I started going. And I'd say, I appreciate you being here this morning. And I'd say, do you know the Lord as you're a savior? If you're died right now, you're going to heaven. And I wouldn't even give them a time to answer, I'd just go home with her out of here. I went to every person, every boy, every girl, I even went by the teachers. Amen. Amen. We're 12 kids, gotta save that morning. I never will forget years ago shaking people's hands and then every now and then somebody would say, sign my Bible, walk up minutes something, if I ever got to the place where somebody asked me to sign the Bible, I thought, oh, I've got it. Anyhow, I got in the habit with this detail, especially with kids, when I sign their Bible and I said, what's your name? And they went, my name's Brandon. I said, hey, Brandon, let me ask you a question. Do you know the Lord as you're a savior? As I'm handing them their Bible back. I just got in the habit of doing that with kids and this lady, and I just don't know how to say it, just an elderly lady. She had snowy white hair, sweet lady, we'd been in meetin' all the way home. And anyhow, she handed me her Bible, it's a preacher sign, my Bible, and I said, yes, man, I'd be honored. And I signed it, and as I'm folding it, I said, man, can I ask you a question? I said, do you know the Lord as you're a savior? And even in my mind, bro, this detail, I thought, why not just ask this lady there? And brother Ali, she looked at me and she said, and she snatched her Bible. She said, yes, I do. Like it offended her, that I asked her. Can I say something? It's never offended me. If anybody asked me, was I saved? And I thought, I wonder if the old sister may be missing a little something. She's missing a sweet spirit, I know that, man. I should question that. The reality, I think I've convinced you, and I can't even be able to prove that tonight somebody's going to hate it. And I don't know that it's somebody here, but I can guarantee you somebody within hand's reach of somebody here, will soon fall for the time. Wouldn't surprise me a bit to come into the house of God tomorrow night. And somebody said, creature, I had a friend in the car red, or you say, why? Because it's happened to me times. But tonight I don't ask your question. And I don't want you to tell me what your mama said or what your daddy said or what Papa said. But I want you to answer in your heart, ask your question. If you were to take that final breath. You know that you know.
