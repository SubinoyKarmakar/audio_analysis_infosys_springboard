 God said, well I didn't know, oh yes you didn't know too. And see what he'll do is he'll take you back to a service on November the 30th, 2017. A little church by the name of Pleasant Valley Baptist Church, went a loud mouth of nopsious Baptist evangelists from Tennessee. He said, yeah, he said, yes you knew. Yes you knew. And what he's gonna do at that day, he's gonna go to that book and ever person. He's gonna take the time. You say how you know that, because that's what he said. He said, whoever's name was not found written, so he's gonna look safe and threatened. He's gonna come to you and he's gonna say, all right. Oh. The next person. See if you go back to the book of Matthew, the book of Matthew paints a picture. Of those that are gonna say, Lord did we not prophesy on their name? And I'm not name cast out many devils and I'm not name doing many wonderful works. And he's gonna say, depart from him, I never knew you. You know how he's gonna be able to say that, I never knew you, because they're names, not in this book. I preach a Christian school service one morning. I ain't been able to talk about a challenge, some of the most challenging services of Christian schools. Because most of them are a bunch of self-righteous blowhards. Amen. They got their tags, their identities, they got their hair right and their clothes are right. And they've got everything right and it's a bunch of self-righteousness but anyhow. That's another story for another time. And I'm telling you what I preach that I don't even really remember what I preached on, but somehow in the end of it, I ended up not coming out of the pulpit just like I am now and I started going. And I'd say, I appreciate you being here this morning. And I'd say, do you know the Lord as your Savior? If you're died right now, are you going to heaven? And I wouldn't even give him a time to answer, I'd just go home with her out of here. I went to every person, every boy, every girl, I even went by the teachers. Amen. With 12 kids, I gotta save that morning. I never will forget years ago shaking people's hands. And then every now and then somebody would say, sign my Bible. I thought, man, that's something. If I ever got to the place where somebody asked me to sign the Bible, I thought, oh, I've got it. Anyhow, I got in the habit with a distal tale, especially with kids. When I sign their Bible and I said, what's your name? And they went, my name's Brandon. I said, hey, Brandon, let me ask you a question. You can't afford it as your Savior. As I'm handing them their Bible back. I just got in the habit of doing that with kids and this lady. And I just don't know how to say it, just an elderly lady. She had snowy white hair, sweet lady. We'd been in meet and all the alone. And anyhow, she handed me her Bible. It's a preacher sign of my Bible. And I said, yes, ma'am, I'd be honored. And I signed it. And as I'm folding it, I said, ma'am, can I ask you a question? I said, do you know the Lord as your Savior? And even in my mind, bro, distal, I thought, why don't I just ask this lady there? And brother Ali, she looked at me and she snatched her Bible. She said, yes, I do. Like an offended her that I asked her. Can I say something? It's never offended me. If anybody asked me, was I safe? And I thought, I wonder if the Old Sister may be missing a little something. Ma'am, she missing a sweet spirit. I know that, ma'am. I should question you. The reality, I think I've convinced you and I can't even give a biblical proof that's not somebody's going to hate. I don't know that it's somebody here. But I can guarantee you somebody within hand's reach of somebody here will soon fall for you. But it surprised me a bit to come into the house of God tomorrow night. And somebody said, creature, I had a friend in the car red. You say, why? Because it's happened to me times. But tonight I'll ask you a question. And I don't want you to tell me what your mama said or what your daddy said or what Papa said. But I want you to answer in your heart. Ask your question. If you were to take that final breath, will you know that you know?
