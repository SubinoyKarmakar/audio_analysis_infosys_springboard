 There's nothing hard to understand about those exhortations, and there's multiple exhortations in the New Testament to New Testament believers. So the Bible's plain in the exhortation. And I think that such an admonition by the apostles should be naturally embraced by Christians, because we're Bible believers. You'll be told to worship God by singing from the songbook in the Word of God. So you don't need a sermon from me. You don't need a sermon from John Calvin. You don't, you're like, well, yeah, I didn't think of that. That's a good idea. It ought to be an immediate childlike response that says, yeah, that sounds great. How come I didn't think of that? Well, you didn't have to think of it. The apostles thought of it for you. And they've already told you. Didn't you read those books of the Bible? Well, I missed it. I just went by me. I understand that. That can happen. It's happened to all of us. But then you pointed out, and somehow it nothing changes. And it is the inspired word of God. Do you have another song that can compete in its perfection and glory to that which has been inspired by God for the singing of the saints of God? I don't know how you do that. It ought to be natural. No modern Christian music can claim divine, infallible inspiration like the Psalms can. And there's no like, but well, Psalms are meant to be read. And we can pray the Psalms and all this is true. There's multiple uses to the Psalms. But ultimately, the Psalms are meant to be sung. It is a song book that is contained in our Bible. And there are musical instructions in the Psalms themselves. We know that they were sung and they were intended to be sung. In some of the headings you have to the chief musician. And then you see some of these archaic Hebrew words which are instructions of what to do musically. Obviously, the Psalms were meant to be sung. And they were sung by the children of Israel. And we'll be in total the New Testament to sing them. And in these introductions, we also have designations like a song of degrees or a song of David. We'll be in total their songs. There's nothing hard about that. So it ought to be natural for us to follow through. And so my question would be not so much nevermind how it is that modern Christians don't emphasize the Psalms in their worship publicly in their assemblies. The bigger question to me is how is it they completely ignore them? And how is it they completely ignore them even when you mean it for their good, when if I tried to exhort on the vitriol, my point is look, I grew up and we didn't sing any Psalms. I never sang a Psalm. I mean, once in a while in a hymn book, you'd have a version of Psalm 100. You almost never sang it. You always sing in Fanny, Crois, Beyes, Isaac Watts and all that. Okay. So we weren't Psalm singing. But when I was sort of confronted with Psalm singing by coming to the label and as soon as I saw, I thought, you saw the books and we took them out and I'm like, hey, this is kind of a cool idea. And I had no fear about it. I never heard of a pastor. Good you need to talk about it in the radio. And I never, maybe he said something in the past and never taught on it. And the title of the Psalm was Psalm such and such with these verses. Wow. And then we'd say them and some of them were to tunes we knew, hymns. I didn't need a sermon on it. It was the most, this is great. Why is it that we can preach and teach and try to exhort with it? And I thought it would be a great blessing. So when I'm exhorting, I'm expecting that they'll find it too, but you just want to wear. You weren't thinking in that vein. I'm trying to help you out here. And all day that's wonderful, great. And they go home and turn the TV. They'll never bring it up to their minister and they'll forget about it. It's a different experience than what I had. I'm trying to understand it. I think there are several factors that account for this. First of all, there's ignorance of Scripture. You can read through a passage of Scripture and walk right over the treasure hidden the field and never know that it's there. I mean, I did that throughout so many passages in Romans and Ephesians. When it came to the Israel of God, I walked right over it. Didn't even know what I was looking at. And I thought I understood these things, you see. So that can happen with it. It does say Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs. But there can be an ignorance there. And part of the ignorance is the byproduct of a lack of leadership in their ministries. The ministers don't teach on it. They have nothing to say about it. And they don't lead by example and say, you know, let's, we'll sing a hymn. But now, let's sing one song too. They just don't do it. So they don't have the teaching. They don't have the leadership by example.
