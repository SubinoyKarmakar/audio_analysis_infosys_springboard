 Just going to be kind of very transparent tonight. I left the room, didn't know what I was going to preach tonight and had two or three things in mind and just seemed like the more I thought on that, the more my heart was. I'm disdained from that direction. And even as I listen to the singing, I try to discern. I listen to what the Lord orders and what people are singing. And man, we've sung all around with this. Still in my heart, I was in a little bit of a turmoil. I believe this would be the direction the Lord would have us to go in. I be honest with you, I'm not grasping at straws. I really have good clarity in my heart now. I'm going to be honest with you, I've been in this thing long enough that if I didn't feel like the Lord wouldn't be the preacher, I just take a seat. My heart is heavy though. I'll be honest with you, I'm going to say this and I know we're live streaming and ten years ago we didn't know what live streaming was. They wouldn't live streaming ten years ago. But we are now. So I'm going to say this, I'm going to say this and I'm going to say this as a word of admonition and also a word of warning. I've saw God's power and His presence move in this meeting like I've not saw in a lot of places this year. I'll be honest with you, if there were one factor, I would factor into that, I would have to contribute that to God's people being willing to be receptive to the Word of God. Can I say something the greatest truth in this Bible is worthless if we don't choose to live on it? I mean you can know the book from cover to cover but if you're not willing to live by it's worthless to you. They might. I mean you know and I use this analogy, it's a very obscure analogy but there were through the years where you'll understand this, there was a way that people would put a roof on a house and all that kind of stuff. But things have changed and now they've got these people coming in and they've got these guns and they're air guns and they can throw them shingles on and with all that new equipment they do it so much faster than they used to. Can I say something with even the modern convenience if they chose not to pick it up and use it, they're just hurting themselves. Amen. I mean they still get the job done, it's going to be longer, it's going to be harder, it's going to be more difficult. And that's the same way with you and I as the people of God if we choose not to listen to the Word of God or we choose not to apply the Word of God. And I'm going to say this, I'm going to say this is kind as I know how but we've got to the point where we live in a day where we're selective with what we like to pick and choose and use. We need to adhere to the whole council of God. It was a little weak right there. We need to adhere to the whole council of God. Amen. You know I'm not being ugly but you know John I like John 316, amen I do. I like that verse, I like that verse but I don't say the same Bible that contains John 316 is the same Bible that contains those verses where it says be you separate thus say the Lord. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen and so that's where my struggle is because I've seen what God's done in your midst and can I say this and I'm not trying to be spooky or nothing like it but with that being said I also know that the devil doesn't like that. And so I know what he'll start doing. I've seen him too many times. He's predictable. Amen. Amen. So he's going to start doing everything he can to try to steal those seeds that have fallen on good ground. Amen. Amen. You say preachers crazy, he's lost his knees just a little nutty, just a little messed up and all that kind of stuff. But I want to make a statement today you can either choose to listen to what I'm saying and you better guard yourself. I'm going to be honest with you. I've struggled really hard about preaching to you. I even mentioned it. I think a little bit last night over I think it's Luke chapter number 22 where Jesus, the Lord comes to Jesus and said Simon, Simon, behold Satan, that's hard to have you that he may sift you like we. Can I be honest with you? Amen.
