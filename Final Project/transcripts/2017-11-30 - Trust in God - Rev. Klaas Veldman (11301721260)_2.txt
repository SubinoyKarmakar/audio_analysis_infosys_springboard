O, that they would repent, not only say, I shouldn't have done it. That they would accept judgment and back from mercy in the dear son. Return us and today, in canon and united states europe and all the country. I would, I don't know what's going to die good later, but I'm begging it.

But a young man as a brother, not a father, not a nirvana brother. Speak comfortably to those who die people, and the people of God who have sinned. Speak out of the gospel, that they might believe and trust. And if you forgive it as a sin in Christ, Jesus alone. Now the other woman as mothers, the younger woman as sisters. And then he says something in operative, he says, Timothy, it's dangerous talk to women. Not because of the women, but because of you. In operative, with distance. Not even for.
