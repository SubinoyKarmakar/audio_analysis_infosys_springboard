 that this tribulation is for the glory of God and God's love is nurtured in a heart both toward us and us toward Him and we are able to rejoice and love God in the midst of that tribulation knowing that that tribulation is working the experience of loving God even going through hard times. In other words what he is saying is we have a hope in the future glory but we can glory and rejoice in the present suffering because we can find God sustaining grace we can find God's wisdom we can find the grace of God and the wisdom and understanding and the knowledge of God in the midst of that trial so that we can magnify Him not just grit our teeth and go through it and but we can actually rejoice in it we can be built up in it we can be more than conquerors as he's saying here. Now what we do this as we die to self and walk by faith not by sight this is what the Bible teaches we walk by faith not by sight you see this is where we have to understand God this is where we have to trust God this is where we have to find the power of the Holy Spirit we want good determinations we want good choices but if you wake up in the morning and all you have is a choice and a determination that you're going to do right today this not going to work God doesn't want us to live by choice he wants us live by the Christ power he wants us to trust in him he wants us to know that we are dependent upon him see God is pleased with a heart that is dependent upon him blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of God now poverty of spirit is not somebody well where's the problem man I'm gonna take the bull by the horns I'll take care of this no the idea is through the Lord's help according to the Lord's will by the Lord's power through the power of Christ I can do all things you see we have the confidence but the confidence is not in ourselves it is in his power it is in his wisdom it is in his might is dressed in the armor of God standing in the strength of the Lord and so this is the idea that we find in the scripture so all things don't just work together he doesn't say all things work together he says they work together for good for good I mean let's look at Jesus for an example I mean there are a lot of bad things that happen to him but notice how all of it worked for his exaltation and the accomplishment of his work which is our salvation everything that worked in his life was to teach us and him setting an example and was a means of accomplishing our redemption everything about his life was good even all of those bad things that happened even on the cross which was the tremendously worst thing that could happen of any individual magnified many times and yet it was that which became joy because there he conquered sin death in the grave there he delivered us you see that's the idea now this is not worldly optimism it's not just wishing well like people say well don't worry everything's gonna work out now first of all what right do they have to say that it may not work out according to what they're thinking what they mean is that if you find out you have cancer don't worry everything will work out they're gonna find out it's not really cancer something I don't know what it really means by that everything's gonna work out but if we trust God we know that everything is working for the good even if it doesn't in the eyes of our understanding as we say work out in other words it may not work out according to our understanding may end up that the cancer's undead but we know and have the knowledge and have the wisdom and have the understanding that is for the glory of God and it's for our good God knows beyond our thinking and above our thinking and you see this is the idea so we know why do we know because we have God's word of promise that's how we know this in verse 28 it's included right in the verse and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God I mean he's telling us this in other words this is God's promise that's how we know it our lives are controlled by his purpose given to us in Christ by the election of grace before the world began go with me to second Timothy chapter one second Timothy chapter one and verses eight and nine second Timothy chapter one verses eight and nine be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord nor me as prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions
