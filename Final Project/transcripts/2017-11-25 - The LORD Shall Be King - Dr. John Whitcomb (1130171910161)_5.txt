 all available for you to listen to again and share them when you go to sermonaudio.com slash Whitcom. Find that page easily from our website, Whitcomministries.org. Whitcomministries wishes to express its deep appreciation to Middletown Bible Church and Middletown Connecticut for allowing us to provide you with this content, and as always, we're so grateful for the stations and outlets that carry our program. I'm Wayne Shepard, and on behalf of Dr. John Whitcom, I thank you for listening to our radio ministry and for praying for us. Stay involved with us throughout the week at facebook.com slash Whitcomministries, where you can read a series of devotionals that Dr. Whitcom is written for this Christmas season beginning this week. And then, please join us next weekend for much more Bible teaching. You know that's what you'll always find when you take time out to encounter God's truth.
