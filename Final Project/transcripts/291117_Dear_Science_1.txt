 And so, sort of the guts of this is that the way that these positrons and neutrons and stuff get emitted is these gamma rays hit the nuclei of, in particular, nitrogen atoms and oxygen atoms in the atmosphere. And when it does that, then they, once they've turned into other isotopes of nitrogen and oxygen, they then emit these, what we call subatomic particles or whatever, and those are the ones that get detected. And the nitrogen turns into carbon and the oxygen turns into nitrogen. It's all very, all very interesting, all very inverted. Yes, indeed, yeah. So, are they, no, no, no, no, no, go go go. Are they trying to harness this kind of energy or? No, they're not, but they're just sort of interested in the fact that this happens. And now they've got a possible way to account for the formation of these unusual isotopes of carbon and nitrogen in the atmosphere. And is that, are they damaging to our atmosphere or? No, no, they're okay. They're okay. They're not radioactive or anything like that. So it's just carbon 13 and nitrogen 15. They're just very uncommon isotopes of both carbon and nitrogen. And so now it's been shown that basically these can be formed by lightning. Where we in the laboratory have to do it, and cyclotrons and all these big, expensive, enormous apparatus, nature can just do it by itself, which nature is pretty good at. So, yeah. So that's quite, it's kind of cool. You said in the beginning that this was, you know, lightning is one of the purest forms of electricity. Yeah. When you said that, is there like non-pure? No, no, it's pure electricity, I think I said. So I think some say I was just paraphrasing somewhere. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So. Good fact, you came well. Yeah, I want to know if I need to be honest. I need an electricity purifier in my house or something. Oh, geez. You look on the web. There'll be things for that. I guarantee it. People will be selling you pure electricity. I guarantee that. All right. We're moving on. So today is a special day. It is. It is. It's the anniversary of shroating his cat. What does that mean? No, I'm trying to find this meme. I wanted to talk about the meme, but I wanted to get it right. So if you tell us, what shroating his cat was? Okay. So this all harks back to quantum mechanics. Okay. So the reason we're talking about this today is because... Yes, actually, because I didn't use it that it was a study that... That... It's a study that showed the problem with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics. There we go. And I didn't actually know even what the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is. And not many people do. So should we start there? Okay, we'll start there. So today in 1935, the paper was published. All of that shroating his cat. Now, I think probably a few listeners would have heard maybe of shroating his cat, but possibly might not know what it's all about. Well, it's because it's often used in, I guess, popular culture, right? Absolutely. It's used to describe a certain situation. It's definitely one of those things people bring up at parties to seem like they know stuff. Anyway. And then they don't have to explain it because it's just too difficult to explain. So, you know, you wouldn't understand it. But Alan, you're going to explain it to us. Well, I'm going to try my best. So, quantum mechanics is weird. Number one. Okay, so back in 1900, everybody thought that they had everything pretty much sorted out and that Newton's laws of matter and everything were all okay, and you could describe the entire world. And physics was basically going to be a dead science because they knew everything. There was only one thing that they couldn't understand. And that was why things give out light when they're excited. Okay, we don't need to go into that too much, but there was some studies of that. And then somebody comes along, okay? And Guy by the name of Max Planck, and he says, no, Newton's wrong. Newton's wrong. Einstein comes along, says, yep, Newton's wrong. We've got this thing called quantum mechanics now that we're going to use to explain the universe. And quantum mechanics was introduced by a shroatinger in Heisenberg in about 1926. Okay, now Einstein, the whole thing about quantum mechanics is that it is just weird. It's almost incomprehensible. Okay, it's just very, very strange. And it all relies on probabilities rather than the certainties, et cetera, et cetera. And one of the weird things about quantum mechanics is that particles can be in many, many, many different states at the same time. And once you observe them, then they're forced to choose one of those states. Okay? So it's the act of observation that causes... To sting the channel. To adopt a particular state, let's say. But that state could change tomorrow. Yes, yep. So which particular state gets chosen is a matter of conjecture. But it's got to choose a particular state. Okay? And this is where shroating is ket, Kamesen.
