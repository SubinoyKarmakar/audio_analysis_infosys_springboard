 for a woman's life and murder them in the hometown that I'm from, a young lady, a Christian, a young lady that had a testimony of knowing the Lord Jesus Christ was abducted on the way to school. The men who abducted her did deplorable, unmentionable things in the pulpit to her and then dismembered her body and scattered her all over the county. And I'm telling you, you think in the way and I'll just go ahead and just give you a little pierciology right here, as far as I'm concerned when people do those kind of things, I believe they're demon possessed. Amen. You say, well, I don't believe in demon possessions. Well, there's probably other parts of the Bible you don't believe in either. Amen. Amen. Can I say something about it? Listen, if Jesus was dealing with demonic possession in his day, do you think it's got any better in the day in which we live? Absolutely not. But the problem is this, we've got medical doctors. It's went and got medical degrees and they've come up with new names and we've covered it up and we've medicated it up. But the fact of the matter is it's still a reality. People are demon possessed that do those kind of things. The deeds of men, what they're doing, their works, that's what we're talking about. But can I say something that is just as violent, just as vain as the abominable and deplorable works of men? Can I say something? There's some people that are genuinely doing good works and they think they're good deeds are going to gain them some kind of merit having. Can I say something to not? And I don't mean to discourage you. I don't care who's told you you're a good person and how many people have patted you on the back and said you're a good person and you do good things to people and man and God loves that and all that kind of stuff. Can I say something? It's good to do good. But it won't take you to heaven. Amen. Can I say something to not outside of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ? That's the only way you're going to make it to heaven tonight. Outside of a personal relationship with Him, can I tell you something? I have people telling me this and I can and I bounce with it and used to bother me a little bit because I could but then I got over that. But the fact of the matter is I remember the day, February 24th, 1985. I remember the town, Parsons, Tennessee. I remember the place south side Baptist Church. I remember about the time it was around 11, 13, 11, 15, 11, 30, something like that. The whole thing goes, convicted my heart, showed me I was a sinner. I made my way to an altar, bowed my knee and I called out on the Lord to save me and guess what he did. You may not be able to remember a date or a specific time. I always say something. You can't tell me that you've met Christ and He's changed you that you don't remember when it happened. So I'm going to say this, I was there when it happened. I guess I ought to know. Amen. I know. I mean, if you can't know a date and you can't know a time and you may even forgot I've heard this, I don't even remember what the preacher preached and all that kind of stuff. I tell you something I know when I met the Lord Jesus Christ as my Savior. I don't say something tonight. The fact of the matter is this, you can work yourself to the bones. You can do good. You can money to the church. You can help this brother out and help this sister out and you can be a morally advantageous person. But your morality and your works, it'd be better for you just to cut a hand off. Amen. The number two, He said this. He said, he said, not just the hand, but number two, look what He said, He said the foot. He said, I foot a thing, they cut it off. Not only does the hand speak of the deeds of men, what men are doing, their works, the foot speaks of the direction of men. It's where they're going. It's their ways. Can I tell you something? I've heard this statement through the years and we have, I want to make a statement right here. And I'm not falting and I'm not downgrading and all that kind of stuff. All these, these 10 step programs, 12 step programs, all these programs. But what they do is they push and they push and they push and they push to reformation. Heard a fellow one time he said this, he said, preach, I turned over a new leaf. And I'll be honest with you, y'all know this by now. Sometimes my mouth operates before my mind kicks in. And I looked at him and I said, I don't care if you turn the whole tree over. I said, if you don't go Christ, you're going to hell. Amen. Amen. Amen. Can I say something? Well, you know, I preach, I used to have a bad tongue and boy, I've got my tongue under control and man, I used to, my mind used to be a bad place and now I think good things and all that kind of stuff. That's just changing. That's just reformation. You say, but preacher, you say that if a man's in Christ, he's a new creature. Yeah, that's not you changing. That's him changing you. That's not you changing you. I never will forget I heard this years ago and I went to an older pastor for some advice.
