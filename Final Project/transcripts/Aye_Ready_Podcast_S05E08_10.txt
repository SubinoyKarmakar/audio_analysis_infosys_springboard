 the foundation raised 91,000 pounder their annual charity ball at the Hilton on Saturday. So, finally. Great stuff. And this one here, I don't think there will be many Rangers fans buying this anyway, but Craig White appears to be bringing out a book about his time at Ibrox. It was partially leaked online, don't know how. And he said to be absolutely raging about that. It's going to claim corruption, match fixing, along with other scandals. So, that'll be a top seller, Derek, with the green white side of the city. I've got absolutely no doubt. So, make his money off of that. Exactly. That's one cany because I've actually literally written the same thing in my notes here. So, yeah. And our recent study has shown that Celtic players earn more than double hour players do. Hour players earn more than double hour Dean players do, which, yeah, both are no real surprise. But it's just maybe a wee reminder to some pundits that when they try to justify the European hammer in Celtic, I've taken it out for you. And they claim it's all about wages, but just look at our league as well then. Exactly. Exactly, Derek. Yep. And we have got here, man who had penis hacked off by women with pruning shares claimed it was a sex game gone wrong. Haha. I had a dread to think. Or say, I might have keen guard, or something like that, would say. Sergio, aged 40, who also lost his testicles, claims he was blindfolded and aroused during the attack as pressed up Brenda Baratini, the Argentine Loretta Bobbit. I was going to say he was a keen guard, but he was about uphill guard, nothing of. It was pretty much reported that the 40-year-old rock musician named only as Sergio F was asleep when he was allegedly mutilated by a stunning blonde architect Brenda Baratini. But as you do. But his lawyer today insisted that he was both blindfolded and aroused while the fact took place. Haha. I'm grimacing here actually, I think I'll be there. But here's a question for you, are pruning scissors no quite small? I don't know. There's a picture of them here in the big proper Shears, Gal. Oh, shears, right. The lawyer acting in defence of Baratini said there's justification for what happened. The information I've received is that she was the victim of a sex attack. She let him into the apartment because he's someone who's in a rock band and he's in a quaintance of her brother. But once inside, instead of removing a musical instrument as he was supposed to, he attacked us sexually and assumed the defensive attitude. Whether or not she acted excessively is for the cause to decide. Haha. She's the Donald Finley of Argentina's law firms or law institutions do you think? Well, I don't know what. Hope somebody gets off because he certainly never did. I don't know for what else. Exactly. Haha. She's wearing these boys' fur earrings. She's got her own ear rings, a whole shoe box full of nut dangly ones. So, that about wraps up the podcast. Oh my god. We're under an illness. Unbeliefable. 53 minutes at all. Yes.
