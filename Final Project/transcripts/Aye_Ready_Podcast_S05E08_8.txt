 the ball fired and in the box cleared the way then deal Gordon fired the shot into the box as well cleared the way that then very early on in the fifth minute we actually took the lead. I don't know if I'm a court, he's headly. But I need time. I probably just have to make a lot of noise, Gordon the day goes, that's a great effort by Gordon. And by headly. What should I finish by headly? One nail to range on, five minutes and the first half gone. It was a ball into the box and it was a nod on by Alama, a coise to deal Gordon. Deal Gordon had a shot which was saved by Snelder's. It came back out to mark atleast any score, then absolute peach of a volley, battered it was a tremendous, actually quite reminiscent of the goal that Kenny Miller scored last season against Aberdeen, absolute cracker, Rangers went in one nail then after that Aberdeen trying to get back in there, the free kick on the left hand side which was cleared to Hans Hillhouse on the byline. Well beaten by Haydale back defending down goes Hillhouse, that's a penalty kick. Gary Stevens, coming in at back of Hill, that was a very clumsy fashion and it's got to do it all being vain. Well this is an amazing one, rash challenge from a top-class defender with top vital kick for Aberdeen. The re-virtual kick catch, Aberdeen, they go on. The other team's catch and what's going on is going to be done with an amazing reflex here. But it was actually tackled to be Gary Stevens, quite a clumsy tackle because he was going nowhere. Hillhouse is brought down, clear penalty, Aberdeen which they took, ten catch, took a slotted home, that then made it one one. Like I said, you could hardly catch a breath, there was something happening, constantly. So it was early on, it was one one. Aberdeen then came all out all guns blazing, they had a shot to the defender, then back out to the wingers who had a shot saved by Andy Gorham, who managed to hold the ball and really good saved by Gorham, then marked hately shot from a defensive mix up which was well saved by Tio Snell, the end to end, but then on the 35th minute. Here please, small and tight picked up by McGorham, fine play, by here please, pace is good enough here, it's a great chance for Rangers, that was brilliant. The goal of the brief quality by Mark Haydley, he started that ball by himself with that pass and the call to Super Ball, then it exploded pace, took it away here from David Gory, where the wise for the finish, now that's coming out another angle, he's in the back and stunned on the ball. From our byline, Gary Stevens played a great ball up to Alain McCoy's on the right wing, still in our half, Mark Haydley had made the run on further up on the right wing, Alain McCoy's found him with a great ball, who then played the ball to Stuart McCoy, Stuart McCoy, turned round, he found Mark Haydley overlapping him, played a fantastic pass through to Mark Haydley and he just set off like a rocket, passing Brian Irvin, he left him for dead, gets to the edge of the box and just fires an unstoppable shot past Snell does, absolutely sensational goal by Mark Haydley, Mark Haydley is very best to make it to one to Rangers, then after that Aberdeen trying desperately again to get back into the game, but Rangers had a hold on it, they were making Aberdeen, the only thing they could do against us were some long range shots, then we had another great chance to mark Haydley, which could possibly have been a penalty, it was a free kick in the box, Richard Gough headed it back across the face ago, marked Haydley with a dive in head, I just missed it, but I looked as if there'd probably been an infringement just beforehand, so maybe a bit on lucky note to get the penalty there, that went in half time, Rangers winning two-one, as I say we played really really well, Aberdeen had got back into the game quite quickly, but as the game the first half went on, Rangers were shown their dominance in that one and it certainly continued into the second half, with another great chance there, David Robertson to be Kyle Achenko down the left hand side, who just left the defender for David, a fantastic turn, he had these cross-blocked and then put it back another shot, which was saved by Tiel Snowdors, and then on the fifth minute, just 10 minutes after half time, we went...
