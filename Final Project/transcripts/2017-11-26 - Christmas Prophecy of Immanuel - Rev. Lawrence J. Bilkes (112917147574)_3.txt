 punishing wicked kings even. And when as Psalm 2 says, the heathen rage, the people imagine a vain thing, and the kings of the earth set themselves together. And they take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed, then Psalm 2 says, but he that's seteth in the heavens shall laugh. He shall have them in derision. No, the enemy will not succeed. They are just like fire brands, verse 4. The Lord says there. Two of them are worse than one, that's true. But they're just like two sticks in the fire. They burn more violently, but they're just smoking fire brands. Their threatening will vanish into smoke. Here's the confidence of the church that God is God. And God is on His throne. And God rules even when everything seems to be wrong. And that's reason to trust Him. That's another lesson we draw here. Trials are God's call to trust Him. God's trials are God's call to trust Him. There are trials here for AS. They make Him afraid. But the trials also in your life are calls from God to trust Him. That's what the Lord wants AS to hear to trust Him, verse 4. There are four commands in verse 4. And they're all calling Him to trust Him first. Take heed. That's a word for watching and waiting. Psalm 59 verse 9 says, because of His strength I will wait upon the, for God is my defense. Yes, waiting on the Lord. That's the call to depend on Him. Take heed. Secondly, be quiet. Be quiet. It's a word that's used after the people of Israel came into the promised land, defeated their enemies. It's all happened under Joshua. And then it says in Joshua 11, verse 23, and the land rested from war. That's the call, be quiet. It's a call to rest. It's the same word that Isaiah will use later for the fruit of righteousness in Isaiah 32, verse 17. And the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness, quietness, and assurance forever. Take heed. Be quiet. Fear not. The third thing that's said. Fear not. It's the same word that's spoken to Abraham in Genesis 15, where we meet him after the Lord had given him victory over the enemy, but Abraham seems to be afraid. Maybe afraid of retaliation. He doesn't live in high-walled cities. He lives in tents. He's exposed to danger. He feels vulnerable, but the Lord says to him, fear not. And then the fourth word, neither be faint-hearted. He has as afraid. He's not the only one who has ever been afraid. What are you afraid of? Boys and girls, what are you afraid of? And be afraid of those who don't like you. Who aren't kind to you always. Or maybe you're afraid that you'll get sick. Or afraid that things won't go well at work or in your business. Maybe you're afraid of getting a disease. Maybe you're afraid of being alone. How many fears can there not be in our life? Trials seem to bring out fears. What's the trial in your life? Whatever it is this morning, you see what the Lord does. He wants to turn you to Himself. He wants to have you take refuge to Him to trust in Him. That's what the Lord Jesus wanted to affect also in the lives of His disciples in the New Testament. Remember, boys and girls, when they were on the boat? The sea of Galilee and the storm rose. And the disciples are trying to keep the boat from sinking. The Lord Jesus is sleeping. And but no matter what the disciples do, it doesn't seem to help that finally they cry out to Him. Master, carousel now that we perish.
