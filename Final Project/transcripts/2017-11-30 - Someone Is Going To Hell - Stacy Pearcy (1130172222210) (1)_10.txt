 God said, well I didn't know, oh yes you didn't know too. And see what he'll do is he'll take you back to a service on November the 30th, 2017. A little church by the name of Pleasant Valley Baptist Church, went a loud mouth of nopsious Baptist evangelists from Tennessee. He said, that's good and told you that there were people that were going to hell. He said, yes you need, yes you need. And what he's going to do at that day, he's going to go to that book and ever person, ever person, he's going to take the time. You say how you know that, because that's what he said. He said, who's the way that's name was not found written, so he's going to look safe and to you and he's going to come to you and he's going to say, all right. Oh. The next person. See if you go back to the book of Matthew, the book of Matthew paints a picture of those that are going to say Lord did we not prophesy on the name and I may not cast out many devils and I may not do many wonderful works. And he's going to say, depart from him and never knew you. You know how he's going to be able to say that, I never knew you, because they're names not in this book. I preach a Christian school service one morning. And I mean, you talk about a challenge, some of the most challenging services of Christian schools, because most of them are a bunch of self-righteous blowhards. Amen. They got their tags, their identities, they got their hair right and their clothes are right and they've got everything right and it's a bunch of self-righteousness but anyhow, that's another story for another time. And I'm telling you what I preach that I don't even really remember what I preached on, but somehow in the end of it, I ended up and I come to another pulpit just like I'm now and I started going and I would say, I appreciate you being here this morning and I'd say, do you know the Lord is your Savior? If you're died right now, are you going to heaven? And I wouldn't even give him a time to answer, I'd just go home with her out of here. I went to every person, every boy, every girl, I even went by the teachers. With 12 kids, I got to save that morning. I never will forget years ago shaking people's hands and then every now and then somebody would say, sign my Bible. I thought, man, that's something, if I ever got to the place where somebody asked me to sign the Bible, I thought, oh, I've got it. Anyhow, I got in the habit with a distal, especially with kids when I signed their Bible and I said, what's your name? And they went, my name's Brandon. I said, hey, Brandon, let me ask you a question. You know the Lord is your Savior? As I'm handing them their Bible back. I just got in the habit of doing that with kids and this lady, and I just don't know how to say it, just an elderly lady. She had snowy white hair, sweet lady. We've been in meet and all the way home. And anyhow, she handed me her Bible. She put your sign in my Bible and I said, yes, ma'am, I'd be honored. And I signed it. And as I'm folding it, I said, ma'am, can I ask you a question? I said, do you know the Lord is your Savior? And even in my mind, bro, distal, I thought, why don't I just ask this lady there? And brother Ali, she looked at me and she snatched her Bible. She said, yes, I do. Like it offended her that I asked her. Can I say something? It's never offended me. You're offended by the ask me, was I saved? And I thought, I wonder if the Old Sister, maybe missing a little something. Oh, man, she missing a sweet spirit. I know that, ma'am. I should question. The reality, I think I've convinced you, and I can't even give a biblical proof that tonight somebody's going to hate it. Now, I don't know that it's somebody here. But I can guarantee you, somebody within hands reaches somebody here, will soon fall for the time. Wouldn't surprise me a bit to come into the house of God tomorrow night. And somebody said, creature, I had a friend in the car red. Or you say, why? Because it's happened to me times. But tonight I don't ask you a question. And I don't want you to tell me what your mama said or what your daddy said or what Papa said. But I want you to answer in your heart. Ask you a question. If you were to take that final breath. You know what you know.
