      "  De hulp en Only Expectation is in the name of the Lord who made heaven and earth who keep us through forever. Never forsakes the works of his own hands. Grace mercy and peace be unto you from hand at is and at was and at is to come from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ which is the faithful witness. First, we guard on our death and the prince of all the kings of deep earth. Amen. Congregation, let's sing together for 26, 4 and 9. The Lord preserves the meek most. Tendily, broad night to death in him I found salvation in 9. I am a Lord I serve and bound yet free in what form. I am a Lord I live and I am a Lord I live and I am a Lord. I am a Lord I live and I am a Lord. I am a Lord I live and I am a Lord I live and I am a Lord. The reading of the Holy Scriptures can be found in one-tibleth in 5. The first 16 verses, one-tibleth 5 runs from 16 before 12 articles. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth and in Jesus Christ is only begotten Son our Lord. Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried, he descended into hell. The third day he arose again from the dead, he ascended into heaven and stood at the right hand of God the Father Almighty. From then see shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost, I believe in holy Catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and the life everlasting. First Timothy 5, starting at verse 1, Rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father and the younger men as brethren. The elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters with all purity, honor widows that are widows indeed. But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn, first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before God. Now she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusted in God and continue within supplications and prayers night and day. But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth. And these things give I in charge, I'll read that again, and these things give in charge that they may be blameless. But if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel. Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man. Well reported of for good works, if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work. But the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to act want and against Christ they will marry. Being damnation because they have cast off their first faith. And with all they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house and not only idle, but tatlers also and busy bodies, speaking things which they ought not. I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully. For some are already turned aside after Satan. If any man or woman that believe with have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged, then it may relieve them that are widows indeed. Let's take the phrase of Lord Impregna. And thou would pray enough with unspeakable words, what attend to thee and for the comfort of thy people. When these speak words, what are words without a heart, they are about working in our hearts, we sigh and sometimes we can't even say what we sigh about. So therefore we draw an eye into thee. Thy heart goes and we're doing. And even if sometimes it seems to be that there are a lion for thy people like Job sought, thou art still doing good, for thou art only good. And righteousness in thy goodness and good in thy righteousness. Remember as this evening that we may open the scriptures to the honour of thy name, to the welfare of the souls, to the comfort of thy own. There was please opening and hearing and speaking, we confersed at the least of thy benefits where I'm worth it. And Lord did it only words only, that thou would humble as that of food so, begging for the great numbers yet. That's an idea, son. Lord, we pray, be with those who couldn't come and don't want to come, though it already don't need food, don't need a wake. If mercy upon us be alerted, we might be continual, have enjoy in the word that's thy son. We will, the world, in which starting to be dangerous will the be a fire that can be taken out anymore. What's going on, when all the sins are made publicly, O, that they would repent, not only say, I should never done it, that they would accept judgment and back from mercy in thy dear son. Returners and today, can and united states, Europe and all the country, I want, I know it's going to die good pleasure, but I'm begging it, I need will be honored in the conversion of the people, the resting, and the foundation thou is laid, the cornerstone, the dear son, of mercy upon us, we ask it in Jesus name, amen. The congregation also, in all ways, in the loveless of Paul, the last chapters are the anemoneses, the anemoneses is, we can also say exhortation. First nor really deals with the doctrines, and in the last chapters he exhorts the church to walk in the ways of Lord. You see it also here when he spoke to Timothy, he says, if you deal with all people, don't rebuke them, don't reproach them, but in treading, the word in treading is comfort, speak in comfort, talk to him out of the gospel. There's no obligation in grace, that's only grace, this grace. He says, you should be speak to them very graciously out of the gospel, so if you see an old man sinning, you should comfort him, you could say, Christian, with a comfort in Christ by a true faith, by his righteousness, not condemning him or approaching him, but speaking in treading as a father, as a father of the church, fathers in grace. But young man asks, brethren, not above but not anirred brethren, speak comfortably to those of thy people, of the people of God who have sinned, speak out of the gospel, that they might believe and trust, and to forgive it is of sin in Christ's teases alone. Now they all, other women as mothers, younger women as sisters, and then he sells something in operative, he says, Timothy, it's dangerous talk to women, not because of the women, but because of you, in operative, with distance, not invoking, flesh relusts, that's dangerous in the church, in operative. And old pastor said to me, always, never go to a widow all by yourself, take an elder along, it's better. Now that's not because of the widows again, but because of the elders, the deacons, the menace, both in operative. And then he goes and speaks about the widows from the first floor through 616. In the early church, the widows were deacons, not off in an office, but the older women, the older widows had a service of deaconery to be a deacon. Do you know one? Dorkas. She made clothes for the poor, served the Lord. That was not an office to be a deacon, but it was the service of a servant for an older woman. But she had to be older than 60 years. For widows under the age of 60 should remain. It's clear. And then it makes the difference between widows and two widows. A widow means left alone, have in no help. That's the widow. The widow is the type of decherts, even. God is the husband of the widow. In the church is almost and always sometimes, in the Old Testament already, said to be a widow. He know the story of that old communist rider, and he was in Dalwelyn, Britain, a socialist. He was in the world time. He had a place in a Christian home of an old widow, but he said, she was always depressive. I didn't know what Christianity was. And in one time, I asked her and said, why are you always so depressive? You know what she said. My husband, the Lord Jesus, is in heaven. He had long for him. What's he like to walk us? Anymore. And I heard that man say in it, and I thought, hey, he got a true Christian, a true widow, and I asked him, wait for our husband to come. The husband of the church, of the bridegroom, has left alone here, he's in heaven, but he will bring the church home again. Now, well, we first see how Paul says that, for the widow should be cared. He should be cared if they are children first of their children. Parents should be cared when they are getting older first by their children. That's a false. Not first by the deaconery, by the deacons of the church, by the money of the church, but first by the children of the widows. But there were some widows who had no children, no family left. Husband died. You know one, Anna. Anna, Anna. She was a widow, and she had only lived with her husband, I think, eight years or seven. She had been for a long time in widow. You know what she did? She was a true widow. Where was she always? In the house of the Lord, and her husband was the Lord, and we know what she did. Bring in and bagging, night and day. That's a true widow. But it's a Jesus. And the husband will pull her drawer home in due time. But also, if you were a widow, and you had no support, the church would do it. But you couldn't easily get support of the deacons in the church. You had to be in that number. You had to show, even when you were an old widow, you could help others, but they had to show. Did you ever got free with a widow? You see, you say, you're in no, I'm stopping in that sink first. But 128, 12 and 3, 128, 12 and 3. Well, these are refuge in our strengths day of the widow.

The help of every year in which war. The help of every year in which war. The help of every year in which war. We have been out of the Mildred, but in three days as a father and a younger man as a brother and the elder women as mothers and the younger sisters without purity. What does this say? What were it love? Faith says Luther enters into heaven in Christ and love comes down. Communion of faith. Family of God. All the brethren called them fathers in Christ. Young the brothers is brothers. The footballer always say brethren or fathers. John says the same. John speaks even about the marks of fathers and sons and brethren, little boys. But I'm saying this congregation doesn't rule the law. What's the full full law that's left? One word that fulfills the law, is the law of him and love among the brethren, his love. So if you bring the law back, you disregard it or the gospel. Did I know the fruits of the right? The law is full filled with the following one word that's law. And if you don't have the law of your tinkling symbol, and you have nothing, no fruit. And he says when you talk to them, don't review them, but speak comfortably with them. Comfort them. They say, oh man, I know your situation. I know that you're attacked, and I'm attacked too. Going your knees together and praying back for worship. That's the excitation Paul speaks about in his first two versions. It's conformable to what I preached at Sunday night that we're not under the law but under grace. So if people are coming to you, say you have to, and you have to, and you have to, it will invoke more sin. But love and love. Grace is love. Now I've said that you should deal. He said to Timothy being careful in the ministry and opportunity. Walk decently, attacked. I've seen menace this fallen, not from grace but from their office, because they didn't walk. Impurity. Now when we have said the ace that we come to, the next and that's important. He says there are widows in the church. It's great that he doesn't speak about widowers. But I believe even a widow is an example of a true Christian. So if he is a widow or a young man, if you have this spirit of knowledge to be a widow, Christ is your husband. Not here. Well, if any widow and then he deals with how to support him in the first place, have children or nephews, so children of a brother or a sister, let them learn first to show pity at home. Widows are in the first place to be helped by the family. A old people in the first place should be helped by the family. nephews, even. Love of the family in the latter days there won't be any natural love anymore. It should be among the churches different. The other is my father and his old, I can take care of him anymore. The world today doesn't know anymore what love of God, not what love to what's God. And even among his people it's called. So not first in the first place by the collections of the church, by the deacons, the first of family, if the family abandones you, that's his thing. Now I believe my children don't have money, that's another thing. But the widow should be helped, the widow means helpless and without things that are fair. The head ace, someone who has no wealth, no support anymore, is lonely. There's no how to feed herself, first the family. No fuchsia even, the abbot that's of my father, mother, you know. And to requit their parents, do you know what it says? We quit their parents, their parents took care when they were little babies. But today, parents take care when they were little babies, but when the babies are growing old, they don't need to take and don't want to take care of the parents anymore. That's the dying. You think God is pleased with it? It's not pleased. You know what the widow would requit means? Pay back. The mother took care of you, washing your clothes, feeding you. You don't take care of your mother anymore. We need houses for it and installations and services paid. The abbot, I don't want to rely on my children, say that's not the problem. But you should first buy it at home. They don't like me, first buy it at home. Love again. To requit their parents. At least it began. For that is good and acceptable for God. It's a command, honor, thy father and thy mother. But for those who don't say it's a command, he says, it's acceptable to go up. It's pleasing to go up. We understand the info. I don't know if he don't. We'll not under the law if you're a Christian who speaks to Christians here. They're not under the law. Both says, I'd like to go by the law that I might live and to God, that I might have a desire to seek the favor of God. And you can do it by law. You can only do it by raising Christ Jesus. We've seen in these days that people bring the law back behind the gospel, exploiting the gospel. That's anti-Numian. The law has only one purpose to perfect and racist. Come and mind it. But I'm not under the law, but under grace that's the fulfilled law, it says James. That's love. We should need every need in the word of the word, especially in this point. Do you know how it comes? Conviction is not done proper, in preaching. And therefore, grace is no grace. The love is no love. It's always mixed. I have to and I must. You're going to lust. You're not under the law. But under grace. That's too easy for me to pass the law. Grace is very difficult. You always want to pay. The Lord Jesus had an impeller. Because if you have a feast, a dinner, ask those people who can't pay you back. Because you normally make a dinner for your friends who can have and give you a dinner. But God makes a dinner for those who can't pay the back. That's nice. You're not able to do it. Broken ends, broken hearts, and a blind eye that's the nature of a man. Grace is outside of me in Christ. But it seems to be that the gospel has no power. You know what Paul says? The promise, the will, the will, the law. Glory to you being turned on the pleasure of God. It's grace. The city of Jerusalem is free. And then I come and it's a past that I must say, oh, bull guy, you're still must. Bull guy, you must. You never died to must. Did you die to must, dear friend? Oh, bull guy, Christ there is no power. You're on your own, the comestive. No. You see it in the fruit. That's our must pray. God's people can't pray. You know what the Lord Jesus says? I need you to pray, but I say what you should pray. I make you a child not ready to pray, and I say it. Play after me or pray with me. Our Father, my Father and you, the Father, which are there. All of hell won't be diner. No, my name. Be it. Must not be, but be it. Nogging to grace. That's good and acceptable. Here, he didn't say that's a command of God who doesn't say it. He says, that's well pleasing to God. Again love, love, love. And if you were true Christian, you had one desire. Tell me what desire. That God might be glorified and pleased. Isn't it? So he doesn't say a must because he was the fulfillment of the law. But he says out of the gospel, it's pleasing to God. It's grace. And I come to our visitation year and year and a past year, must it to him or his head. Then I go to such a stone of my breast, I think, you shouldn't be here and you should never come back. Because they are just idiots. They are just idiots. God's people are the bag of people. For grace, the food you grace, in Christ, love. Now she did suudo or true riddle. The true riddle backs her grace. That's fine. And desolate, trusting God. That's a true riddle. Having no family, no Neptune, no brother, no sister. Trusting God, then you need a living God, isn't it? Now the word God, no long God, the deglaze is gone. I know a widow, who has been passed away, was a prophet, as he had from rising. So he had no money in. He had to sell the children for slaves, probably to live a bit. As he came to one of the prophets, if you know of these sases, it's a wonderful thing. He says, make yourself empty fuzzles. That's first what you need to know. Make yourself empty fuzzles. As much as you can. But the average season, she said, a little by a while, will make yourself empty fuzzles. Take your aisle and fill. You must trust her. Otherwise I wouldn't take that bottle for a big little bottle of wine. Will you? You would say it to stay in the world, you would say that minister is the fool. But I'm not a fool. The world is a fool. Thinking that Lord cannot fill big sisters with oil. Out of a little bottle. You only the mother, another one, to be great. That's faith. But faith fills always little bottles, empty bottles. Do you understand me enough? Faith fills always empty bottles, empty sinners. Hey John, Janan is the last of them, boy. The last one was filled to the room. God said, stop oil. Stop oil says the word stop oil. No, no. Sell them a leaf. Pay your bills and live by the rest. Faith is things for the world, but even for the world people to live by faith is sometimes hard. Isn't it? We have only empty bank accounts. Believe in that God can fill it. I know it. I know how God fills an empty bank account. So they had to study with free children. I said, Lord, I can't afford it. I have no money. I'll make it. I need it. God's people combination, whether on the best place have only empty bottles, empty systems, with God fills them. That he might be honored. Not a love with grace. Not a duty that only be receiving. Isn't it that God gave you all the old things? And did he do it because your parents are well and did so good? Did he not write it? That widow could hardly believe it. But God does it and he makes you to believe it. Not the other way around. People say today, first to believe in them, God does it. No, God does it and makes you to believe it. They have to comfort God. Faith is not a condition, faith is a fruit of grace. And that's good and acceptable before God. Now I have passed them. Now what does then a true widow that's the type of a Christian's Anna? She has to be more than 60 years if she is less than 60 years to be shoot, she should be married and have children again and educate them for the church. God sees, sees. When you are 60 you are not fruitful anymore. I'm not saying it with the number he has given you 60 years. Now what's then the duty of such a widow about 60 years or a widower? To continue his supplication and prayers night and day. Those widows are the prayers, ringing the fourth prayers before God like Hannah did it. When she prayed that God will fulfill his promises. When we have widows, more than 60 years old, they are separated to pray. First supplication. What's the supplication? The supplication is what I desire now. A supplication is what God wants to give you in the promises, doing all what's supplication, doing the promises to God. Not your desires, but what God promises. If the promise of God is not leading your prayers, it's only self-interest. Sorry. And I did it. He says, Lord, thou has said it, and I shall come and I beg thee to show him to me as he has confessed it. I, he, a children of God, bring in the promises to God for the last revival before he turns, that comes only viable. Yes, the foolish Virgin, one who will be seen, the difference again, and then Christ returns. That's what I beg thee. The Bible says so. So I've said, no, to end. No. He will awaken his church just before he comes. And he says, the church will be like, for I fight for the vision of my wife. And the promises to be prayed for, that you have promised that you have, and I know you bring the day and night before the end. In your best hours, then do I sometimes, you'll be so afflicted to you say, I don't know anymore. But they should pray with supplications, that on the promises of God, not your desires, but his desires. And the word they ask is means, even if he wouldn't answer me, I can't say anything. But I still back and continue to back. It's the prayer of a beggar. My dear, it's the prayer of a beggar. A beggar has no rights, then only praying for grace. And his rights, if you are a Christian, are God's rights. And his promises, he will fulfill, and the right God is no God anymore. Secondly, prayers. Impress the word for prayers is worship. I have a different question for you. Meet your worship, and even if he doesn't listen to you, you will hear. With your worship God, as God, because he gives, but only is. If he wouldn't give you anything anymore, with your self-worship, if he would say to you, I have to chat with you. With your worship, for God has God. Let's praise. We'll be doing the night, sometimes during the day. No, yeah. Supplications and prayers, night and day. You know, supplications and prayers in the most dark hours of your life, prayers and supplications. Night and after the night comes a day. Jacob wrestled with a man. No, God wrestled with Jacob one, when during the night. And when the sun was rising, he was set free. And he got the promise. God exercises his people. Do you understand me? Or am I fool? God exercises his people mostly in the dark hours of your life. When it seems to be dead, the sun is not shining anymore. It seems to be all over. But after the night, dear friend comes a day. And the sun was shining, no late. Day in night and I had it. She was 84 years. How long had she prayed? Preeding on the promises, begging not worthy. But worshipping him for himself, for his sake. As he has seen him in glory, let's sing first that 251, 1 into 351, 1 into 2. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them. And when the sun was shining, no late. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them. Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them. With those who say, all they are not truly with us, they don't trust in God, don't continue in supplications, nor prayers, night and day. But do they do? After a while, after a year, and the husband passed away day, go shopping sometimes and liking the pleasures of the world again, forgetting, seeking the joy of the world, all the days, past I am allowed to go all the day, I am saying pleasures that please is the fresh. I can make a different thing of it, can you? I can. But I am not truly with those. They don't have judgment in heaven, in the loners, and afflicted. They want to be pleased in the world and want to be pleased by the world. The might have been a year that it seems to be they were truly converted, some impressions, probably even I have been passed away and went to heaven. But after a year, I can always be said, let me ask from joy to seeking the pleasures of the world. Have you called it common grace, fallen from faith, this ball? Temporary faith. Yeah, I'll truly weigh those. But seeking again, the pleasures of the world, like a man and like a man again, be like my man again. Job, but if you are under the sixty-on, then he says you have to remain, that's true. You are right. Before you burn. She is dead while she lives. Spare truly dead. And tell them that through where those should be blameless. The deep things given charge that they may be blameless. Did I listen, my dear friend, listen? Isn't it your desire to be blameless? Why I say this because anti-nominance say, I am of blameless and I can't help it and have an excuse. I am even worldly and so I love the pleasures of the world and I can help it and be a spiritory debt. And I am not saying that the child of God is always spiritual, vivid. I am not saying it. Now I go to the deep of your heart, what's your longing to be pleasing your God? What it might be? That's what God gives you. Love. He says, with the two windows, and the two windows, there are two windows who can't provide for themselves. But I've said it before with the window of Elijah. If any provide not for his own, then he speaks to the congregation, but that the window be taken into the number, which God provides for in the congregation. Now there's a deconess with the more servant windows where on the account living of the congregation God provides. Now you're, that's not easy for the congregation, especially in the early ages of Christianity, the church consisted mostly of poor, not wise, not wise, not rich. If you read the first ages of Christianity, give a mostly slaves. Good hardly live. And if there were riddles in the church and they had no family name, it should be provided for the sustenance by the church. What I found in this portion of the scripture is that the early church were well organized. They didn't say, we support her today and tomorrow we don't know. If you had no support for your family, if the family didn't support their work, then largely people he says. But if there was a true widow, then she had no support to church or to support her. No. Go out to support church and her. I believe in, in the end. I believe in the end of the church of ten members in five widows. You would say, two widows, you would say, how can we support them? No, I make it a bit difficult here and more. If we had a congregation only of ten widows or twenty widows, do you think God would provide for them? Yes, He would. Truly widows. Even when there were no businessmen in church with a big wallet. We easily say, I live by faith, we easily say it. But we like our bank accounts, we turn. We do have only empty vessels and you have ten widows in the church. And no one to provide God will provide. You liar was sent to a widow, and you had a widow. For the book did at no water, but anymore. The raven didn't come, yet stolen from the table of Ahead for it. A long time, but now the book ended in no water. Now He says go to a widow. Go to a widow. He didn't say go to a widow, it's Christian there somewhere. He said, no go to a widow. God is wonderful. The liar would have thought, oh what sent me to a widow. What can a widow mean for me? And there he went in his foreign water, did he see? I'll try it, he says. If the widow can really provide, he says, what are you doing? He said, take a short walk and all boy have an abid of oil and abid of oil. Grind it with ground wheat, and then I make my last. God Lord, add our sending me to widow with nothing. All people of God, all people of God. The abid living God, the abid living God. Now He says, mother, and he tried her, he says, mother, make for me the pancake. And God will provide for you with me to, but first me, first God. When the widow said that you would provide for me, so, make for me, he says, make for me. There she went. When she had baked a pancake, I don't know what he baked. She looked the can into the bottle, this way, while it looked. When she looked to the wheat, same. Every time she had to empty the bottle, it took a bottom and God provided it again. God provided for you, servant, for the widow together. Do you believe it? Or do you believe that we have to have ten bags of, in a big cup? As the, when I say this, I show my even fleshly desire. Trusting in an empty bottle and an empty system. No, that's not it, pastor, no. Trusting in God to fill my empty system, my little boy, bottle, bottle. She trusting God and God will provide. An old lady, travel God, live and out of God's hand, I have nothing to cover anymore. But what she did was, she put a plate on the table and a fork and a knife and was waiting. Someone knocked at the door, but she didn't immediately open. She lightly said, thank you Lord for all that I have provided for me. She didn't want God to be there, is all not looking to a table without food. That worshiping God, even if things are against you. Then he knocked at the door and he said, look, a back of weight, potatoes, weight. He had thanked before she got it. That's great. Because God is honored. But to that number, that will be provided for in the congregation. It should be a widow where you see some marks of grace, pastor. Why now these marks of grace, wow? Reported for good works. Not that she would report herself for good works, but that the people like Dorcas, who are sustained highly because of grace is worse than see to care of many poor people, making clothes. I don't think if you would have out Dorcas, he had a lot of good works in her. Where's nothing? Can you remember it? With report. She must be a matter of children spiritually or literally. She must have some experience of taking care of little children. If you can take care of little children, probably God will give you the privilege to take care of each people. No pastor, wow. When Peter was restored in the office, the first thing he got to care of, was that, what? Tell me, the lands. The little ones. There's no ones. The pideon, which lived on the count of the Lord. She likes to have some strangers in them. Why? It might be among them an angel. It's the best. Guess you can get. Have you ever received an angel in your house, tell them not? Worse the same feet. We the least of all saints, servant. Wishing the feet, you know, was awake work of the slaves. He didn't see you. Jews didn't do it. Therefore the disciples didn't do it. He is dead. The Lord Jesus did it. God's people don't do it in Christ, then they do it. Be in the least of all the children of God in the congregation. Those will be supported. How do you get to be the least? You need great grace. You want the age you get the lower you go. No, give me the example again. Let me do it. Your sins, your guilt is forgiven. No, I'm never making any deaths anymore. But they didn't take long, two months later. He had a big of deaths again. He says, I have said that I'll always pay your debts. So he knocked again at the door and he said, give me your bills. He took them right hat. But it didn't take long. He made a good guilt and debts. And again he knocked at the door. That good shepherd. But he didn't dare to open the door. And he opened. Not worthy. Then you get to be small, small. The more grace you get, small. No, process, although I am nothing. But nothing, you don't become nothing by the law and by your obligations. You become nothing by grace. I try to be nothing in the way of my conversion. I think I thought, let me crawl on the earth like a worm. And I try to crawl only for as a worm. Do you know? Gets me, no peace. Do you know when I got to be nothing? Can you tell me when you got to be nothing? When he became your all in all. Not worthy that he would come into your roof. That's practical religion. That's grace is grace. But old congregation, that old man is such a rotten man. You always fight the new man. That old man, that old rotten man, that back of war was that back of war. So if you really think you've flipped it. And a diligently never reaching the goal with their diligently forward. Like Paul says, I chase for holiness. He said, but I'm glad. I'm probably not right word, but you know what I'm saying. He took me. There for a long for it. God's people are never coming. Yeah, when, at the end of the rope. Christ is there. And He provides the years as the alpha new may go. You need for time and eternity. But the younger women, He said, come and grace the like again the world. What's wanted against Christ? He says in the most merry to seek an argument. Ask for argument. For if they don't, it goes wrong. They seek and walk from house to house, talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk. Women that never come to knowledge, talk and talk and talk and talk. That's Ireland, Mansions, talk. But Dad was also busy bodys always speaking about either saying, or the man should do it. They are past the year, you know, a man. You should do a different man. Busy bodys, busy bodys. Have you been a pastor? You know what's busy bodys. You always are standing on the sideline and they know what you have to do and to preach and to sign. That's it. Busy bodys. Know what always better and to live better, know it better. The better ideas, better truths, but don't know anything, no, no, no, anything. You know what happens? You thought you were converted by the cemetery of the relevant, very serious, but it lasted not long. Christ wasn't in it. You know what a bodys are? Some already turned aside after Satan. They've seen in the forty years of grace many people of whom I sought had first impressions, waiting for grace, with after a year they turned. Never been made alive out of death in Christ, dead while they live. Have some shining sins, or the sins said, self-good works, but given over to Satan. Outside of there and only husband for a true widow, God's people is a widow church. Your husband in heaven and he will get you home in due time. Amen, that way. Lord, it's just convicting. It's showing us looking to all the things of pleasure in the world that should disfine a flesh. Ah, Lord, ah, Lord have mercy upon me. That fool, that fool. Have mercy upon thy people, have mercy upon those who don't know thee, and even still be at the fresh passes and sins, might be religiously, very religiously, like the soul of Tarsus. Namely, what can according to the law but not knowing the gospel? Always last but never. That grace is with, have mercy upon his Lord, forgive my sins, impregnate, praise, and hearing, and apply to the idea of son to our souls. He is the husband man, that's so friendly, that shares all he has, his blood, his body, his kingdom, his heaven, his glory, have mercy upon the Lord for Jesus' sake, I pray. Amen. Let's sing last name, that's for 17. I think not all three. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. One and two. There's a million in peace receiving the blessings of the living God. A love of Father, the grace of Jesus Christ, the communion of the Holy Ghost, bread with your own.\n",

      "SUMMARY:\n",
      "  The reading of the Holy Scriptures can be found in one-tibleth in 5, starting at verse 1, Rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father . The elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters with all purity, honor widows that are widows .  Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man . Younger widows refuse for when they have begun to act want and against Christ they will marry . With all they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house and not only idle, but tatlers also and busy bodies .  Lord, we pray, be with those who couldn't come and don't want to come, though it already don't need food . If mercy upon us be alerted, we might be continual, have enjoy in the word that's thy son . The congregation also, in all ways, in the loveless of Paul, the last chapters are the anemoneses .  In the early church, widows were deacons, not off in an office, but the older widows had a service of deaconery to be a deacon . For widows under the age of 60 should remain . A widow means left alone, have in no help, that's the widow .  Parents should be cared when they are getting older first by their children, not first by the deaconery, by the church, but by the children of the widows . Some widows who had no children, no family left, had no support, the church would do it . But you couldn't easily get support of the deacons in the church . You had to be in that number .  Luther says Luther enters into heaven in Christ and love comes down . The help of every year in which war. which war . We have been out of the Mildred, but in three days as a father and a younger man as a brother and the elder women as mothers .  The head ace, someone who has no wealth, no support anymore, is lonely. There's no how to feed herself, first the family . Widows are in the first place to be helped by the family. The world today doesn't know what love of God, not what love to what's God .  You think God is pleased with it? It's not pleased. You know what the widow would requit means? Pay back. We should need every need in the word of the word, especially in this point . We've seen in these days that people bring the law back behind the gospel .  The city of Jerusalem is free, and then I come and it's a past that I must say, oh, bull guy, you're still must . You never died to must. Did you die to must, dear friend? Oh, Christ there is no power. Grace is outside of me in Christ, but it seems to be that the gospel has no power .  John Smith: Faith fills always empty bottles, empty sinners . He says he knows how God fills an empty bank account . Faith is things for the world, but even people in the world live by faith is sometimes hard .  A true widow that's the type of a Christian's Anna? She has to be more than 60 years if she is less than 60 to be shoot, she should be married and have children again and educate them for the church . They have to comfort God. Faith is not a condition, faith is a fruit of grace. And that's good and acceptable before God .  I have a different question for you. Meet your worship, and even if he doesn't listen to you, you will hear . With your worship God, as God, because he gives, but only is. his desires . Let's praise. We'll be doing the night, sometimes during the day. Supplications and prayers, night and day .  Odee, O Lord, I live my eyes, O now entrown the bondage by His servant, to watch their masses hand and watch for them . Job, but if you are under the sixty-on, then he says you have to remain, that's true .  In the early ages of Christianity, the church consisted mostly of poor, not wise, not rich . If there were riddles in the church and they had no family name, it should be provided for the sustenance by the church . I believe in the end of the church of ten members in five widows .  You liar was sent to a widow, and you had a widow . For the book did at no water, but anymore. For the raven didn't come, yet stolen from the table of Ahead for it. A long time, but now the book ended in no water. Now He says go to a . widow. He didn't say go to . a widow. It's Christian there somewhere, it's Christian somewhere . He said, no go . to a widower . And no one to provide God will provide. God is wonderful.  It should be a widow where you see some marks of grace, pastor says . The people like Dorcas, who are sustained highly because of grace is worse than see to care of many poor people, making clothes . She must be a matter of children spiritually or literally .  The more grace you get, small. get the lower you go. I try to be nothing in the way of my conversion. I think I thought, let me crawl on the earth like a worm. Do you know when I got to be . When he became your all in all. Not worthy that he would come into your roof. That's practical religion. But old congregation, that old man is such a rotten man .  Ireland, Mansions, talk. and talk. But Dad was also busy bodys always speaking about either saying, or the man should do it. They are past the year, you know, a man. You should do a different man. Busy bodys. They know what always better and to live better, know it better, but don't know anything .  There's a million in peace receiving the blessings of the living God.

      "🔸 INTRODUCTION\n",
      " The first we got on of death and the prince of all the kings of the earth . The lord preserves the meek most tenderly brought night to death in him i found salvation and nine i am a lord i serve and bound yet free .  Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old having been the wife of one man . Younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax want and against christ they will marry having damnation because they have cast off their first faith .\n",

      "🔸 MAIN PART 1\n",
      " When we speak words what are words without a heart beware about working in our hearts we sigh and sometimes we can't even say what we sigh about . let's take the fight of lord and prayer. the lord will pray in us with unspeakable words what attend to the end for the comfort of thy people .  In sweden the word in sweden is comfort speak in comfort talk to him out of the gospel . in the early church the widows were deacons not in an office but the older women the older widows had a service of deaconery to be a deacon .  Paul says that for the widow should be cared first by the children of the widows . But there were some widows who had no children no family left. them until ready said to be a widow. They had to show they were a god willing widow .  The help of every year in which war. the help of . every year . in which . war. and 3 128 12 and 3. 128 12: 12 . and 3: 3: 12. and 12: 13: 12: 10: 12, 12: 11: 12; 12: 14: 12 and 12. The help . of every . year. the . help of each year. The . help .\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 MAIN PART 2\n",
      " Paul says congregation in congregation doesn't rule the law, we are the fulfilled law . One word that fulfills the law is love of him and love among the brethren his love . If you bring the law back you disregard the gospel, i know the foot of the grave .  Even a widow is an example of a true christian, she says . The widow means helpless and without strength that's a fair act. The widows are in the first place to be helped by the family. The love of the family in the latter days won't be any natural love anymore.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 MAIN PART 3\n",
      " Pastor says people bring the law back behind the gospel spoiling the gospel . The law has only one purpose to convict and ratists come into mind . But i'm not under the law but under grace that's the fulfilled law says james. that's love. grace is very difficult. conviction is not done proper in preaching. and therefore grace is no grace. and love is no love.  The city of jerusalem is free. The city is free . The pastor says the gospel has no power. But he says out of the gospel it's pleasing to god. grace is outside of me in christ. that's the nature of a man. broken ends broken hearts .\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 MAIN PART 4\n",
      " i know a widow who had been passed away. haven no family no nephews no brother no sister. trusting god then you need a living god isn't it?

      "🔸 MAIN PART 6\n",
      " An old lady child of god living out of god's hand, i had nothing to cover it anymore but what she did was she put a plate on the table and a fork and a knife and was waiting . Someone knocked at the door but she didn't immediately open. She lightly said thank the lord for all that has provided for me. She trusting god. and god will provide. She didn't want god to be this armoured looking to a table without food .  How do you get to be the least? you need great grace. The more grace you get the lower you go. The process although i am nothing nothing. i try to be nothing in the way of my conversion. i think i thought let me crawl on the earth like a worm. do you know? judgment no peace. judgement no peace .\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 MAIN PART 7\n",
      " i longed for it. god's people are never coming. they seek and walk from us. women they never come to knowledge. they don't talk and talk . that's idle nonsense talk. but that was also busy bodys always speaking about either saying i will another man should do it. That was idle nonsense. but i'm probably not right word but you know what i'm saying. he took me. he said .\n",

      "🔸 MAIN PART 8\n",
      " Many people of whom my thoughts had first impressions waiting for grace with after year they turned . never been made alive out of death in christ dead while they live . have some shining sins honest and said self good works but given over to satan outside of their and only husband .\n",
