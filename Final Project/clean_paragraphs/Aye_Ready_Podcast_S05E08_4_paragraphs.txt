last but ive got here as an eight eighth minute win that came off, ryan harde came on. yep. so as i said certainly unexpected and fantastic all round. we can have mentioned on the reaction pod about some of the players. as ive said the whole you know was a wee bit lacking sometimes he gave the ball away far too often from alaykin and miller again was playing far too deep at times and he never really got fully involved. he had a few good onetwos now and again but again if has a main role as a striker why is he playing? i mean he was down in the touch line at the halfway line at some points and i dont know what his role is and i dont know if hes set out to be an outstriker or hes meant to be this roman player. like i said when weve done our wee bit last night that went out on youtube i think in the first half you found it was playing more as you know its out now striker but in the second half is aberdeen slightly got back into the game. he was maybe dropped my bit deeper to try and get the ball but you know it does do it and they live every game now derek so it is quite puzzling what hes been told to do or is he just doing the surface on back you dont know. going obviously tav got matt man of the match derek. he scored the two goals and he got matt man of the match at the great game but i have to say the two standout players for me was the return of bruno alves and of course young macroire who i thought was outstanding and graham what he actually said that he says he says im not just singling him out because hes one of my youth players but he was absolutely phenomenal and even when graham what he changed its slightly in the setting tafin played the 442 he put macroire in the midfield and he just looked a complete natural and there as well derek you know youre a really really ticked talented young player i just hope were not sure on properly as it could be a top top pro and going back to alves like i said last night it was like the quarterback in american football team they was you know right at the back he was getting the ball straight for defence and he was like playing these absolutely sublime 4050 yard passes up to you know whoever was out in the wing there meant a problem he caused just the way he was passing the ball and then you know every single ball high ball that was in there it won every single one of them derek last night and we got a really good view of him especially in the setting tafin is aberdeen were getting in there there was just no way that they were getting anywhere nearer goals with any sort of crosses or high balls in the box because he didnt even have to take a run and jump at the vast majority of them the ability hes got in there was fantastic and i dont think its tvma or have a harder game all season than what he had last night. no i mean its certainly one thing that ive noticed from alves is every time he jumps up for a header he wins it i dont think ive seen it was losing it unlike a lot of other times. every single ball that was in last night derek he won and even you know anything that was getting played along the ground he just last night was the bruno alves that i have been hoping to see ever since we signed them it was cool coming collective he played every ball there was no wasted ball where whatsoever every pass he played every clearance was like a you know a welltime pass and tackle i thought it was outstanding but i actually think that mccroary maybe outshined him last night with how well he played also playing sort of just in front of alves and then going on in a midfield he was outstanding last night. yeah some some they have forgotten to probably mention on the reaction pod as mccroary was phenomenally its not just these defensive duties it was these forward plays well and it was a ability tackle or ability to find the man when he done passes fantastic and as you said yes hopefully some day were not sure were able to keep but we obviously know that were probably going to be more of a selling club now and if a you know a bid came in from then obviously it would need to be seriously considered which something well get into in the in the boardroom section. yeah certainly it leaves us in the table sitting third now that was our game in hand against hibbs where we have played 1518 drawn three lost four scored 31 considered 17 gold difference 14 and points 27 as i said were in third were a point ahead of hibbs who are in fourth mother well theyve got a game in hand against us and we are four points ahead of them were only three behind aberdeen now and we obviously play them next and were seven points behind celtic now but theyve got a game in hand obviously where their game last night was a bit dubious with the way they got the equalizing goal in the last minute but the less said about that the better. as i said the next game weve got is on sunday its
