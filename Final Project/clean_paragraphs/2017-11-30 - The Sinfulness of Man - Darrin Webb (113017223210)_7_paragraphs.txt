thats the good news that we are able to share with people that despite we who are naturally opposed to god, god has put within us his spirit that causes us to wheel and to do of his good pleasure. thats the gospel. and its a beautiful message. it is the message that is the only message of hope for a world who is so opposed to god. and how is it that we are to receive this? well, we must believe. we must believe the truth of jesus christ and repent of our sins and receive him as lord and savior. but when we do that, when we trust christ, then we are born again into the family of god. were made new creatures. were given his spirit. and you know, i spend a lot of time talking about the reality of salvation and how that will we tend to continue in sin when that becomes our nature and we such that we do not delight in god. theres no delight in the things of god. when our spirit is one of rebellion against god, that that again illustrates that we havent been born again. see, the new birth is dramatic. why? because man is depraved. and so the new birth is something thats real. and so we need to understand how these things fit together. understand, man is depraved. but jesus christ, he saves. and thats the hope that mankind has.
