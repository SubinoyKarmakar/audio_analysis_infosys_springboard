you can just take half a joke and theyre already laughing. you say, hey, remember when? oh, yeah, and they can talk about what happened 10 years ago. oh, yeah, and these things you bring up and they they bond you together thats thats the idea of relationship shared experiences over period of time the lord wants the same with us now watch this the more time we spend with god the more boldness well have in prayer the better i know the more bold i can be when i speak to him. i dont mean in a in a disrespectful way. i dont mean a big guy in the sky but im talking about i go to him because i can say lord i remember when you did this when you answered this prayer i can go back and say lord i believe you know, i mean im sure youve had the same experience i get done praying and before im before i maybe four ten minutes are out god has answered that prayer you know to me thats an amazing thing i just prayed about this and then something out of the blue happens, which is an answer to the prayer i just ask about now when that happens i say hey lord remember remember when i prayed and i asked you to do this and you did it boom right away poor what a wonderful god and it gets me more boldness to ask for more things thats what a relationship does the more time we spend with the lord than the more boldness than we have in prayer because we have these shared experiences over a period of time one of the great hindrances to a productive prayer life, you know when we pray okay, were im assuming this that were not catholic here, right? were not were supposed to be born again believers were in a baptist church. we believe in the in the the priesthood of the believer that i go straight to the holy of holies and speak to god himself in a very personal way and so i dont go in there like like a and again not in disrespectful way not like hey lord i got some things i know i go in there and i and i praise him yes, and i confess my sins, but i also go bowling and say now lord youve told me some things and you made some promises to me and lord i expect some things based on what you said and i want you to do these things in my life and all im asking is for you to keep your word that you promised me now lord, i know theres some things i got to do and im going to try to do those but lord im counting on you to do what you promise to do now lord heres what youve done in the past you met this needing youve done this and lord im counting on you do theres a boldness in prayer that the lord wants from now the great hindrance to that the great hindrance to a productive prayer life to a boldness in our prayer life is this we ignore god except in emergencies and we dont know them we have no shared experience we have no answer to prayer to go back on you know its hard to call someone friend if you never ever talked to them you know the the illustration of lord give gave was this you go to a friend at midnight not to a stranger now the what jesus said is okay hes not gonna give to you just cuz hes a friend hes gonna give to you because the opportunity and that and its teaching this idea of begging begging asking but whats inferred in this is he went to a friend not even a stranger i guess would be bothered by the opportunity so there should be this personal relationship we have the lord but we ought to be able to say lord i know you i know what youve done ive seen what youve done in my life and lord im coming again believing and trusting thats what its talking about this idea of relationship this is what the lord wants not just like hes up in sky and looking down like were a bunch of like its like an pharma hes like well look at what are they doing now huh oh i never thought that okay were not an ant farm were not a bunch of hamsters running on wheels god wants a personal relationship he wants to talk and walk with us we give you a couple interesting verses go with me to james chapter two james chapter two now were gonna look at a verse in james and go back to genesis to look at the the basis of this james chapter two were talking about abraham here to look at verse 23 and the scriptures fulfilled what seth abraham believed god and it was imputed into him for righteousness and he was called the what friend of god theres a personal relationship now theres several things thats being talked about here but were gonna go to one of them look with me in genesis 18 were good
