and this is what bradford says. let them pray, and this is all psalms, and let them therefore speak of their condition. hes applying the psalm to the blessing of god of deliverance and hour on the cape. let them therefore praise the lord because he is good and his mercies endure forever. yay, let them which have been redeemed of the lord, show how he has delivered them from the hand of the oppressor. when they wandered in the desert, wilderness out of the way and found no city to dwell in, both hungry and thirsty, their soul was overwhelmed in them. let them confess before the lord his loving kindness and his wonderful works before the sons of men. thats all taken from psalm 107. and they actually referred to psalm 107 as the pilgrim psalm, not because david was writing about the pilgrims in new england, but because the pilgrims of new england were very conversant with the psalms. and when they saw gods providential preservation and blessing, when they got in their knees, they thought of the psalms. you know what? they were psalms singers. it was at the tip of their tongues, and they could worship the lord according to the mandate of scripture. thats my way ahead of prayer.
