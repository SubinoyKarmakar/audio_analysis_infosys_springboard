with those sins, paul, they are not truly with us. they dont trust in god, dont continue in supplications nor prayers, night and day. but do they do? after a while, after a year, and the husband passed away, they go shopping sometimes and liken the pleasures of the world again, forgetting, seeking the joy of the world, all the days, faster i am allowed to go on holiday, i am saved, pleasures that pleases the flesh. i can make a different thing of it, can you? i can. but i am absolutely with those. they dont have jasmine in heaven, in the loners, in the flicktage. they want to be pleased in the world and want to be pleased by the world. the might have been a year that it seems to be there were truly converted, some impressions. probably even those who have been passed away and went to heaven. but after a year, i can always be sad. let me have some joy too, seeking the pleasures of the world.
