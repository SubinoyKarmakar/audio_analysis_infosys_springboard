holy spirit, who has been poured out to draw to this christ, those who are burdened, those who are overwhelmed, that they may see all, you may see all, all in him. we began with moses as a great man. at the end moses falls away. theres moses on the ground. so long as christ may be lifted up, and he may be all, then these doubts and fears were born of my infirmity. though i am weak, god is most high, and on his goodness i rely, amen. let us pray. no gracious and glorious lord god, how great thou art that thou hast laid help on one that is mighty. when thou did see there was no man, none who could save thy own arm, got unto thyself salvation, in the lord jesus christ. i want a burden thou did receive, and also what i wonder that thou does continue to carry. such an unworthy and sinful people in thy arm, and not grow weary of it. o lord god, there is no god like thee, there is no grace like thy name, and we pray, o lord, that thou wouldst encourage thy discouraged people that they may see, that it doesnt depend on them but upon thee, and that thou were faithful, thou were mighty, thou were gracious, and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in the hand of the lord jesus christ. o lord, there were also the one who stretches out thy hands to receive burdens of whatever kind. and so, lord, receive us as we are with all that is wrong and make us what we are to be by thy holy spirit, who has been poured out. bless, lord, richly, each of us, by the grace of thy holy spirit. bless also the pastor of this congregation, minister to him, richly, with the grace of thy spirit. we pray to keep us in this week, to enable us in what we are called to do. hear us, o lord, and forgive our sin in jesus name, amen.
